The one third of the 90                     marks i.e. 30 should be added each in both Summative Assessments.                    Assessment of Speaking and Listening skills (ASL) will be done formally at the term end examination in Summative-II.                     Schools can conduct ASL for Summative-I themselves as per the guidelines provided by the CBSE. However assessment                     of these skills may also be done under the Formative activities spread over two terms.             There will be one written paper of English at the end of each term carrying 70 marks. The time limit will be three hours.

Besides measuring attainment, text serve the dual purpose of diagnosing mistakes and areas of non-learning. To make             evaluation a true index of learners' attainment, each language skill is to be assessed through a judicious mixture of different types of             questions. In addition to the Summative Assessment, Formative Assessment is essential to measure the level of attainment in the four             language skills and the learners' communicative competence. Formative Assessment should be done through 'in class' activities             throughout the year.

Types of Passages :                 The question paper includes three types of unseen passages in order to test reading comprehension —               1.  Factual Passage : It provides facts and information about different events.               2.  Discursive Passage : It provides an opinion, argument, persuasion, interpretation, point of view etc.               3.  Literary Passage :  It is an extract from fiction, biography, interview etc.                 The passage is unseen and is not an extract from your books, so you should not feel disheartened. Comprehension is a             skill and every skill demands practice. So a limited number of passages have been solved to provide model answers and the             rest are meant for practice and assessment.                                                    1.

I am laughing because some foolish thought occurred to me when I looked at              you\". The Goddess became furious and wanted to know what it was. He replied, \"Oh! mother, when I get a cold I find it difficult to              blow the one nose I have. I was wondering how you manage with the ten noses you have, when you catch a cold.\" Saying this he              laughed all the more. The Goddess could not help laughing too, when she heard him. It was the first time that she had laughed at              herself. She was pleased with the young man. So she offered him a boon. She gave him the gift of making people laugh.

As the only country where kidneys can be transplanted from donors              unrelated to the patient, India, and notably Bombay, has gained international notoriety as the capital of the organ trade. Wealthy              patients from India and abroad, unscrupulous doctors and rapacious brokers have made this a multi-crore racket in which the only              loser is the impoverished donor parting with an organ for small money. The legislation strikes at such exploitative transactions by              stipulating that blood relations and spouses are the only live donors from whom kidneys can be transplanted and making the              buying and selling of human organs a cognisable offence. By allowing the transport of cadaver organs, the Act not only opens new              avenues in the treatment of renal failure, where the availability of donor kidneys fall far short of demand, but paves the way for              liver transplants for which expertise exists in India.              Help box –  curbing =  check, restraint; trafficking =  trading; notoriety =  badly known, infamous; unscrupulous =  morally careless,              uncautious; rapacious =  greedy, voracious; impoverished =  made poor, to exhaust resources; legislation =  enacting of laws;              stipulating = making a demand, making a contract;  cognisable = perceptible, recognizable;  cadaver = corpse-like, deadly pale;              renal = of the kidneys.             Questions :               1.  What is the aim of the Bill on the transplantation of human organs?                  (a)  The lives of the people can be saved.                  (b)  Widespread trafficking in organs can be curbed.                  (c)  Donors can be made more rich by giving them sufficient amount of money.                  (d)  Only expert doctors can be allowed.                                                                    10","2.

The Jail superintendent knew that the Hindus and              the Muslims both loved Gandhiji. He feared that if he gave Bapu an attendant who could speak English or any Indian language, it              would be bad for him and for the British Empire. He thought that Bapu would turn such an attendant into an enemy of the Empire.              So he chose for Bapu's service a Negro convict. Bapu and his attendant managed as best as they could with gestures and a few              Hindustani words which the Negro knew. And the superintendent felt quite happy and safe. There was no danger of the Negro              being corrupted. But the Negro received from Bapu such love and kindness that he became Bapu's friend. He served Bapu with              great zeal and love. Seeing this, the superintendent became sorry.

It is this dependence for food, shelter and clothing that has led him to explore all              possible ways to preserve plants from being lost to the ravages of natural or man-made calamities. Accordingly man has used              different methods to overcome these calamities. While doing so, scientists hit upon a technique whereby plants can not only be              restored from being lost but are able to develop a complete plant from a small plant part. This technique, called tissue culture,              subsequently proved to be a boon for mankind. Basically, tissue culture is a technique by which small pieces of different parts of a              plant body (called explants) are grown on a nutritional media under completely sterile conditions. These explants divide and              gradually develop either into unorganised mass of cells called callus or after a few cell divisions differentiate to form full fledged              plants. The concept of tissue culture dates back to 1878 when a German Botanist Vochting said that from a small plant piece, a              whole plant can be regenerated. Later, other scientists like Haberlandt in 1902, postulated that cultivation of artificial embryos can              be possible depending on the nutritional media.               Help box– indispensable =  absolutely necessary; ravage =  to plunder, to make havoc; calamity =  great distress, disaster;              subsequently = after something else;  sterile = unproductive, barren;  postulated = fundamental condition, something taken for              granted; embryo =  a thing in its rudimentary stage.              Questions :               1.  Man has tried all methods to preserve plants because :                 (a)  plants give us natural greenary.        (b)  his dependence on plants is indispensable.                 (c)  plants make us rich and wealthy.        (d)  plants overcome natural calamities.               2.  In their efforts to preserve plants, scientists found a technique called :                 (a)  embryos.                                 (b)  tissue culture.

Passage (5)              Maruti — the name is synonymous in India with a sleek, noiseless luxury, rolling on the roads. In a country that was so used to              seeing only the almost obsolete Fiats and Ambassadors on the roads, the appearance of Marutis in mid-80s was no less than a              revolution. And soon enough, these cars had outnumbered the traditional cars on the road, at least in the metros. One of the oldest              cars seen in India was a Serpollet, a French car named after its inventor. It was noticed by Peter Moore , a professor of mechanical              engineering at the University of London while he was wheeling through India on his world-wide tour. The first car was imported by              the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad in 1895. The first Rolls Royce, known as the Pearl of the East, was brought into the country in 1908 by              the then Maharaja of the Gwalior state, Madhav Rao Scindia, who  was the grandfather of the railway minister during Mr. Rajiv              Gandhi's government. In 1959 the Government of India appointed an official committee, under the chairmanship of an able              administrator-economist, Mr. L.K. Jha, to study the possibility of manufacturing India's own low-budget car, called the people's              car. A similar committee was again appointed under another official, Mr. G. Pande in 1961.               Help box –  synonymous =  conveying the same ideas; sleek =  well-styled; obsolete =  old-fashioned; outnumbered =  more than in              numbers; metros =  capital cities; wheeling through =  passing through.               Questions  :               1.  Which among the following come in the category of obsolete cars?

Passage (6)               Her father, Edward Moulton Barrett was, as Elizabeth later wrote, a very peculiar person. \"Heir to a fortune, educated at Harrow              and Cambridge, he was nevertheless a complete domestic tyrant\". After bearing him twelve children, his gentle wife had little              strength left for struggle against him, and the children never dared oppose his wishes. Yet Elizabeth's childhood was happy. She              romped and studied with her eldest brother, learnt Greek and French, read widely and wrote poetic tragedies. Her own tragedy              began at fifteen with a cough and an injury to her back which resulted in increasingly bad health. Then her mother died. And as              Elizabeth's health grew worse, she became a creature of the shadows and silence. She had a certain independence, for an uncle had              left her a small income. But her brothers and sisters were all at the mercy of Mr. Barrett's harsh rules which hung over the              household like thunder in heavy weather. Chief among them was the absolute refusal to let his daughters marry. He prevented the              marriage of Elizabeth's gay, dance-loving sister, Henrietta, and the scenes that followed broke Elizabeth's heart. Yet she remained              devoted to her father. It was a devotion that served to strengthen the walls of her prison.               Help box –  peculiar =  particular, special; heir =  a person who inherits a successor; tyrant =  an oppressive ruler, one who exercises              unlawful authority; nevertheless =  all the same, notwithstanding; dare =  to attempt, to have the courage to, to take risk of;              romped = to play together boisterously, to wrestle;  harsh = cruel, peevish;  prevented = to hinder, to obstruct;  absolute = complete,              independent.

(b)  that he helped his wife in the household duties.                 (c)  that he ruled like a cruel dictator.    (d)  that he was a disciplined head of the family.               2.  In spite of everything, Elizabeth's childhood was happy because :                  (a)  her father was kind to her.                  (b)  her mother was alive.                  (c)  she had some intellectual interests and was healthy.                  (d)  her illness had not yet crippled her.               3.  What broke Elizabeth's heart?                  (a)  her father's refusal to let his daughters marry                  (b)  her father's refusal to let her sister Henrietta marry                  (c)  her illness which prevented her from getting married                  (d)  the unpleasantness that followed her fathers refusal to let her sister marry               4.  What does the last sentence of the passage imply?                  (a)  The more devoted she was, the more difficult it was for her to leave her father.                  (b)  Her devotion only strengthened her father's resolve not to let her marry.                  (c)  Her devotion to her father was the only thing she regretted.                  (d)  Her devotion to her father made her feel suffocated.               5.  What is the meaning of the idiomatic expression : 'to break one's heart'?

Scientists point out that it is an aftermath of the              eleven year cycle of sunspot activity that has now reached its peak. In a year of the sunspot maximum, they (sunspots) can even be              seen with the naked eyes. Sunspots are regions of the sun where it is cooler than the rest. The big sunspots run from 50,000 to              150,000 miles in diameter overall, into which a handful of Earths could easily disappear. Almost anyday during the maximum, as              many as 25 smaller sunspots — still large enough to swallow our world — are visible through a two or three inch telescope. These              spots frequently swim through the sea of incandescent gases in pairs or clusters and seem to move across the disc as the sun turns              on its axis. Some last for a few days and some last through the full solar rotation of 25 days and may still be growing stronger.              Scientists constantly discuss the pros and cons of the possible effects of these sunspots on daily life here on earth. Although the              precise effects may be debatable, there seems little doubt that the appearance of great numbers of sunspots in the course of the              eleven year primary cycle does have some influence on the weather, auroras, magnetic poles, radio communication and perhaps              even upon the normal course of human behaviour.               Help box–  unprecedented =  without an example, novel; aftermath =  second crop of grass in a season; disappear =  to die away              from sight, to vanish; swallow =  the throat, taste or relish; incandescent =  glowing or luminous with heat; precise =  definite, exact;              aurora = dawn, colour of sky at sunrise.

(c)  Sunspots are solar peaks.                  (d)  They are regions of the Sun where it is cooler than the rest.               2.  What are the effects of sunspots?                 (a)  There are no effects.                 (b)  Scientists are not sure.                  (c)  They may affect weather, auroras, magnetic poles and human behaviour.                  (d)  There is no doubt that great numbers of sunspots may appear in the course of the eleven year primary cycle.               3.

The U.S. has a higher infant mortality              rate, a higher proportion of low birthweight babies, a smaller proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases and a              much higher rate of adolescent pregnancies. These findings, described as a \"quiet crisis\" requiring immediate and far-reaching              action, appeared in a report prepared by a taskforce of educators, doctors, politicians and business people. According to the report,                                                                    14","one fourth of the nation's 12 million infants and toddlers live in poverty. As many as half confront risk factors that could harm their              ability to develop intellectually, physically and socially. Child immunisations are too low, more children are born into poverty,              more are in substandard care while their parents work and more are being raised by single parents. When taken together, these and              other risk factors can lead to educational and health problems that are much harder and more costly to reverse. Most disturbingly,              recent statistics show that American parents are increasingly neglecting or abusing their children. In only four years from 1987-              1991the number of children in foster care increased by over 50 per cent. The crisis affects children under the age of three most              severely, the report says. It is this period that sets the stage for a child's future.               Help box –  lags behind =  to go slowly, to fall behind; vulnerable =  liable to injury, that may be wounded; immunize =  to render              free; adolescent =  advancing to manhood; toddler =  one who walks with tottering steps; confront =  to meat face to face, to oppose;              foster = to promote the growth of, to cherish;  severe = harsh, violent.              Questions :               1.  The main focus of the passage is on the plight of :                 (a)  orphaned children.                       (b)  teenage mothers.                 (c)  low birthweight babies.                  (d)  infants.               2.  Which of the following does not constitute the 'quiet crisis' in the U.S. as per the task-force report?                  (a)  lower rate of babies surviving childhood diseases                  (b)  increasing cases of teenage couples getting divorced                  (c)  lower proportion of new born babies with normal weight                  (d)  larger proportion of babies who are deprived of immunisation               3.

I was standing with my back towards girls in a party and              ultimately when I had to dance, those five minutes were perhaps the worst moments of my life. I was shy and clumsy. Had I been              exposed to girls earlier, I would have behaved in a natural way\". Perhaps most parents will agree with Jonathan, but when it comes              to admitting their wards in school, some of  them will choose a non-coed school. What makes them prefer a coed or a non-coed              school for their children? Jonathan, for instance is an advocate of the coeducational system. \"Fantasizing about the opposite sex is              unhealthy,\" he says. \"If boys and girls are to have a healthy relationship, they have to be exposed to each other from a tender age.              The sense of competition is also more in a coeducational atmosphere. As young people, individuals try to impress members of the              opposite sex.\" Agrees Nalini Borhal, a parent, \"In a non-coed atmosphere, the opposite sex is always an enigma.\" Kanishka, a ninth              standard student shares her opinion,\" Interaction is natural and the sense of competition is fully developed. After all, later we will have              to compete with each other. Does this mean that a non-coeducational school makes no sense? Sharmila Nandy, mother of two teenaged              children is not at all dismissive of non-coed school, \"I have seen that this interaction is being misused these days\",  she says.               Help box –  horrifying =  exciting terror; clumsy =  awkward; exposed =  to lay open; coed =  coeducational schooling, the education              of boys and girls together; non-coed =  where education is given only to the students of one sex; fantasizing =  creating illusion;              tender age = early age;  enigma = a riddle;  interaction = reciprocal action;  dismissive = to put out of thoughts.

(a)  She feels that in a coed school wrong notion can develop.                  (b)  She feels that liberty can be misused.

Abraham Maslow, the well known              psychologist, mentioned with admiration the case of a young man who spent several years in Mexico digging deep wells to              provide clean drinking water to the villages. He managed to dig only three wells and had to spend an enormous amount of time              teaching the villagers to use pure water in place of contaminated water. There might have been only three wells but they gave the              engineer a great feeling of achievement. Charles Darwin has shown that given enough time, small and gradual causes can produce              large and radical changes. His last book was in fact on earthworms. He was preoccupied with the theme for forty years. He had              shown that on every acre of the Chall hills near Down (England), worms brought up eighteen tons of earth annually. What a              stupendous achievement for the small and insignificant earthworm! Even the dullest of men is a million times more creative and              productive than the earthworms. If the men were to work in unison like the earthworms, there would be paradise on earth in the not              too distant future.

Passage (1)               When we are suddenly confronted with any terrible danger, the change of nature we undergo is equally great. In some cases fear              paralyses us. Like animals, we stand still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defence of our lives, and sometimes              we are seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases              of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid man at once, as if by              miracle, becomes possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very              common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death 'gather resolution from despair',              but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight, for dear life. At such times, the              mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel; there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and fury and daring.              Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful              excitement then, but because they brought me a new experience – a new nature, as it were and lifted me for a time above myself.

Questions :               1.  The author names three different ways in which a man may react to sudden danger. What are they?                  (a)  He may be paralysed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.                  (b)  He may be paralysed with fear, run away or fight.                  (c)  He may flee in panic, fight back or stand still.                  (d)  He may be paralysed with fear, seized with panic or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage and face                     the danger.               2.  Why does the author feel happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome?                  (a)  Because he survived his ordeal.                  (b)  Because he was lucky to be alive.                  (c)  Because they brought him a new experience.                  (d)  Because they brought him a new experience and lifted him above himself for a time.               3.  'To lift one above oneself ' means :                 (a)  to make someone a better person.        (b)  to feel a sense of elation.                 (c)  to be lifted out of one's earthy and base nature.   (d)  to experience joy and happiness.               4.

Dancing was the earliest of the arts. Man danced for joy              round his primitive camp-fire after the defeat and slaughter of his enemy. He yelled and shouted as he danced and gradually the              yells and shouts became coherent and caught the measure of the dance and thus the first war song was sung. As the idea of God              developed, prayers were framed. The songs and prayers became traditional and were repeated from one generation to another,              each generation adding something of its own. As man slowly grew more civilised, he was compelled to invent some method of              writing by three urgent necessities. There were certain things that it was dangerous to forget and which, therefore, had to be              recorded. It was often necessary to communicate with persons who were some distance away and it was necessary to protect one's              property by making tools, cattle and so on, in some distinctive manner. So man taught himself to write and having learned to write              purely for utilitarian reasons he used this new method for preserving his war songs and his prayers. Of course, among these ancient              people, there were only a very few individuals who learned to write, and only a few could read what was written.

As for the war songs and prayers each generation :                 (a)  added something of its own to the stock.   (b)  blindly repeated the songs and prayers.                 (c)  composed its own songs and prayers.     (d)  repeated what has handed down to it.               2.  The first war song :                 (a)  was inspired by God.                    (b)  developed spontaneously.                 (c)  was a song traditionally handed down.    (d)  was composed by leading dancers.               3.  The word 'measure' in the context of the passage means :                 (a)  weight.           (b)  rhythm.           (c)  size.                     (d)  quantity.               4.  Man invented writing because he wanted :                 (a)  to be artistic.                          (b)  to write war songs.                 (c)  to write literature.                     (d)  to record and communicate.               5.  What is the noun form of the word 'preserve'?

One's perspective changes and one is continuously thinking of one's own struggles and virtues and failing to the exclusion of other              thoughts. The result is that the same nationalism which is the symbol of growth for a people, becomes a symbol of the cessation of              that growth in the mind. Nationalism, when it becomes successful, sometimes goes on spreading in an aggressive way and              becomes a danger internationally. Whatever line of thought you follow, you arrive at the conclusion that some kind of balance              must be found. Otherwise, something that was good can turn into evil. Culture, which is essentially good becomes not only static              but aggressive and something that breeds conflict and hatred when looked at from a wrong point of view. Apart from the political              and economic problems of the age, perhaps that is the greatest problem today because behind it there is a tremendous search  for              something which it can not find. It is folly to talk of culture when human beings starve and die. So before one can talk about              anything else, one must provide the normal essentials of life to human beings.

(c)  Nationalism and national problems.      (d)  Nationalism is not enough.               2.  Aggressive nationalism :                 (a)  isolates a country.                      (b)  endangers national unity.                 (c)  leads to stunted growth.                (d)  breeds threat to international relations.               3.

We all know that Kerala is much warmer              than Punjab in winter, why? For the same reason, Italy is cooler than India, while England is cooler than Italy. Let us remember this              simple weather fact– \"the further we travel from the Equator, the colder the climate, we get\". And when we travel north or south as              far as we can go and reach the North or South Pole, we find ourselves in a strange white world of snow. These are the Polar Regions              where no one lives and nothing grows, why? Look at the map of the world. One of the lines about which we have already learned              something, is called the Arctic Circle. Every place to the north of this line has at least one complete period of 24 hours darkness                                                                    18","every year. The coldest places in the world are generally between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. But as the Arctic Circle is              merely a line drawn on maps and globes, there is no sudden change on the surface of the earth itself. The cold bleak region lying              around the Arctic Circle is called the Tundra Region, where human life is very difficult. The Eskimos, numbering about 30,000 are              a hardy race living in the Tundra region of Northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland.

(c)  Because it is near the Equator.         (d)  Because it is between the Equator and Arctic circle.               2.  Where are the coldest places of the world situated?

There can be few creatures more improbable than the sloth which spends its life in a permanent state of mute, slow motion,              hanging upside down in the tall forest trees; few more bizarre than the giant ant eater of the savannahs with its absurdly              disproportionate anatomy, its tail enlarged into a shaggy banner and its jaws elongated into a curved and toothless tube. On the              other hand, beautiful birds are so common as to become almost unremarkable. Gaudy Macaws flap through the forest, their              splendid plumage contrasting incongruously with their harsh cries ; and humming-birds, like tiny jewels, flit from flower to flower              sipping nectar, their iridescent feathers flashing the colours of the rainbow as they fly. Many of the South American animals inspire              the fascination which comes from revulsion shoals of cannibal fish infest the rivers waiting to rip the flesh from any animal which              tumbles among them, and vampire bats, a legend in Europe but a grim reality in South America, fly out at night from their roosts in              the forests to suck blood from cows and men.

Science merely reflects the social forces by              which it is surrounded. It is found that when there is peace, science is constructive, when there is war, science is perverted to              destructive ends. The weapons which science gives us, do not necessarily create war, these make war increasingly more terrible.              Until now it has brought us to the doorstep of doom. Our main problem, therefore, is not to curb science, but to stop war, to              substitute law for force, and international government for anarchy in the relations of one nation with another. That is a job in which              everybody must participate, including the scientists. But the bomb of Hiroshima suddenly woke us up to the fact that we have very              little time. The hour is late and our work has scarcely begun. Now we are face to face with this urgent question, \"can education and              tolerance, understanding and creative intelligence run fast enough to keep us abreast with our own mounting capacity to destroy?\"              That is the question which we shall have to answer one way or the other in this generation. Science must help us in the answer, but              the main decision lies within ourselves.

Questions :               1.  According to the author, the real enemy of mankind is not science but war, because :                  (a)  science during wars is very destructive.                  (b)  science merely invents the weapons with which war is fought.                  (c)  the weapons that science invents necessarily lead to war.                  (d)  the weapons invented by science do not cause war, though these make it more destructive.               2.  War can be stopped, if :                  (a)  weapons invented by science are not used to launch a war.

(d)  we replace force and lawlessness by law and international government.               3.

My servant said later that it was only half an hour, and no sound has              ever been more welcome to me than the sounds I heard as my servant laid the table for dinner. I called him to the bathroom door,              and told him of my predicament and instructed him to fetch a lantern and a ladder. After another long wait, I heard the babel of              voices, followed by the scraping of the ladder against the outer wall of the house, when the lantern had bean lifted to the window,              ten feet above the ground, it did not illuminate the room, so I told the man who was holding it to break a pane of glass and pass the              lantern through the opening, feeling that the cobra was behind me, I turned my head and saw it lying at the bottom of the bedroom              door two feet away. Leaning forward very slowly, I picked up the heavy bath-mat, raised it high and let it fall on the cobra. The              bath-mat crushed down on the cobra's neck six inches from its head. I took a hasty stride to the verandah door and in a moment was              outside among a crowd of men, armed with sticks for word had got round to the railway quarters that I was having a life and death              struggle with a big snake in a locked room.

However the demand for quality              education based on the latest research, outstrips the supply, especially so in the fields of engineering, medicine, management,              economics, applied sciences and mass communication. No wonder then, that a number of young people are looking outside the              country for education. Further, there is a prestige value associated with scholarships, more so because it is a hard competition to              bag one. Foreign scholarships in particular give the students an opportunity to interact with international teaching and student              community. It ensures exposure not only to a different education system but also to modern and up-to-date facilities, which              complement the quality of education offered while most foreign universities normally expect overseas students to have good              scores in the qualifying examinations such as the GMAT, GRE, SAT and TOFEL. In the case of certain professional courses like              journalism and photography, work experience is a must for an entry to their advanced courses.

(a)  These scholarships expose not only to a different education system but also to modern and up-to-date facilities.                  (b)  These scholarships attract students for having a large amount of money.                  (c)  A prestige value is associated with these scholarships.

I was tired out, and for two or              three days I slept a great deal. The hot weather had already begun, and I was permitted to sleep at night in the open, outside my cell              in the narrow space between the inner building and the enclosing wall. My bed was heavily chained up, lest I might take it up and              walk away or more probably, to avoid the bed being used as a kind of scaling ladder to climb the wall of the enclosure. The nights              were full of strange noises. The convict overseers, who guarded the main wall, frequently shouted to each other in varying keys,              sometimes lengthening out their cries till they sounded like the moaning of a distant wind; the night watchmen in the barracks were                                                                    21","continually counting away in a loud voice the prisoners under their charge and shouting out that all was well; and several times at              night some gaol official, going his rounds, visited our enclosure and shouted an enquiry to the warden on duty. As my enclosure              was some distance away from the others, most of these voices reached me indistinctly and I could not make out at first what they              were. At times I felt as if I was on the verge of the forest and the peasantry were shouting to keep the wild animals away from their              fields. Was it my fancy, I wonder, or is it a fact that a circular wall reminds one more of captivity than a rectangular one? The              absence of corners and angles adds to the sense of oppression.

(b)  Because the cell was far away from the main building.                  (c)  Because he had been leading an exciting and active life outside.                  (d)  Because the walls of the cell were very high.               2.  What reason does the author give for his bed being heavily chained?                  (a)  Lest he might move the bed from its fixed place.                  (b)  Lest he might use it to scale the wall of the enclosure.                  (c)  Lest he might walk away with it .                  (d)  Lest they mistook the bed for the prisoner.               3.  What are the cries of the guards compared to?

(a)  depressant        (b)  depressed         (c)  depressible               (d)  depression             .                                                             Passage (10)               If the census tells us that India has two or three hundred languages, it also tells us, I believe, that Germany has about fifty or sixty              languages. I do not remember anyone pointing out this fact in proof of the disunity or disparity of Germany. As a matter of fact,              census mentions all manners of petty languages, sometimes spoken by a few thousand persons only; and often dialects are classed              for scientific purposes as different languages. India seems to me to have surprisingly few languages, considering its area compared              to the same area in Europe, it is far more closely allied in regard to language, but because of widespread illiteracy, common              standards have not developed and dialects have formed. The principal languages of India are Hindustani (of the two varieties,              Hindi and Urdu), Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. If Assamese, Oriya, Sindhi, Kashmiri,              Pushtu and Punjabi are added, the whole country is covered except for some hill and forest tribes. Of these, the Indo-Aryan              languages, which cover the whole north, centre and west of India, are closely allied; and the southern Dravidian languages, though              different, have been greatly influenced by Sanskrit, and are full of Sanskrit words.               Help box – census =  an official numbering of population; disparity =  difference, inequality; mentions =  naming, suggestion; petty              = small, trifling;  dialect = the form of a language peculiar to a district;  widespread = spread to a great distance;  tribe = race of              people; influenced =  effect.              Questions :               1.  In the passage the author :                 (a)  compares India with Germany.            (b)  defends the multilingual situation of India.                 (c)  criticizes the illiteracy in India.     (d)  classifies the Indian languages.               2.  One of the reasons why there are many dialects in India is :                 (a)  vast area.                               (b)  population.                 (c)  more communities.                        (d)  illiteracy.                                                                    22","3.  The Dravidian languages have been greatly influenced by Sanskrit. This :                 (a)  makes them inferior to the Indo-Aryan languages.                 (b)  makes them superior to the Indo-Aryan languages.                 (c)  brings them close to the Indo-Aryan languages.                 (d)  makes them very different from other Indian languages.               4.  What is the meaning of the word 'petty' in the given context?                 (a)  small             (b)  meaningless       (c)  unimportant               (d)  worthless               5.  What is the adjective form of the word 'disparity'?                 (a)  disparateness     (b)  disparately       (c)  disparate                 (d)  disparatedly                                                       2. DISCURSIVE PASSAGES                                                 (argumentative, interpretative, persuasive)                   Read the passage given below and answer the questions below it with the option that you consider the most appropriate in your                 answer sheet.                                                              Passage (1)              Unhappiness and discontent spring not only from poverty. Man is a strange creature, fundamentally different from other animals.              He has far horizons, invincible hopes, creative energies, spiritual powers. If they are left undeveloped and unsatisfied, he may              have all the comforts which wealth can give, but will still feel that life is not worth while. The modern mind is shaped by              Rousseau's 'Social Contract', 'Marx's 'Capital', Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species' and Spengler's 'The Decline of the West'. The              outward chaos and confusion of our life reflect the confusion of our hearts and minds, \"Constitutions\", says Plato, \"are but the              reflections in the outside world of the values which prevail in men's minds.\" There must be a change in the ideals we cherish, in the              values we adopt, before we can give social expression to them. What is missing in our age is the soul; there is nothing wrong with              the body. We suffer from sickness of spirit. We must discover our roots in the eternal and regain faith in the transcendent truth              which will order life, discipline discordant elements and bring unity and purpose into it. If not, when the floods come and the winds              blow and beat upon our house, it will fall.               Help box – discontent =  dissatisfaction, want of content; invincible =  unconquerable; chaos =  formless void, utter confusion,              disorder; reflect =  to throw back the image, to consider seriously; prevail =  to gain mastery over, to be victorious; cherish =  to              nurse, to hold as dear; secure =  untroubled by care or anxiety, free from apprehension, safe against; extent =  range, scope;              transcendent = excellent;  discordant = opposite, incongruous.              Questions :               1.  Unhappiness and discontent spring from :                 (a)  poverty alone.                           (b)  ignorance.                 (c)  pragmatism.                              (d)  poverty and moral and spiritual degradation.               2.  According to the author in what respects is man different from other animals?                 (a)  in power of speech                      (b)  in hopes, creative energies and spiritual powers                 (c)  in money and material                   (d)  in physical powers               3.

What do the chaos and confusion of our lives reflect?                 (a)  the spiritual downfall of man           (b)  the abnormality of modern man                 (c)  the confusions of our hearts and minds   (d)  human sorrow and misery               5.

Not in numbers, not necessarily in our moral stands on              international issues. In modern times, the strength of a nation lies in its achievements in science and technology. This is not to say              that other fields do not count. In the five decades after independence, we have yet to demonstrate our originality in applied science              and technology. India continues to be a borrower of science and technology, even though its potential for originality is substantial.              Our achievement in nuclear science and technology may be dazzling to our people. But in worth and originality, they are ordinary              and routine. One subtle way of sabotaging our nuclear goals is to help hollow persons reach and remain at the helm of affairs.              International bodies come in as handy tools in that subtle process. The veil of secrecy effectively protects the mismanagement in              our nuclear establishments. The talk of national security comes as an easy weapon to prevent any probe into mismanagement. On              nuclear matters, the media in our country avoid the investigative approach. As a result the mismatch between promise and              performance in the nuclear fields does not get exposed as much as the mismanagement in other fields.

(a)  Originality and adaptability are duly displayed in the field of applied science.                  (b)  Our achievements in nuclear science and technology are dazzling.                  (c)  Our achievements are of a very ordinary quality and routine nature.                  (d)  Our scientists have given full justice to the development needs of nuclear science.               2.

Campaigns for the eradication of this              drawback gathered momentum in the past four decades after independence. The results are as expected, dramatic. However, while              the percentage of literacy in India is going up the number of illiterates has also been increasing which is really incredible. There is              no need of any sophisticated technique to explain the cause of this paradox, as it is obviously the result of the rapid growth of              population. For instance, from 1971 to 1981, literacy increased at an annual average rate of 0.7 per cent, while the country's              population grew by 2.15 per cent every year. But population explosion is not entirely responsible for the growing number of              illiterates. The apathy of most states in failing to tackle the problem of adult illiteracy is also partly to blame. Moreover, follow-up              measures to prevent neo-literates from relapsing into illiteracy are just as important as the initial adult literacy campaigns. Not              sufficient provision has been made for 'continued education'. This can be done by setting up more rural libraries, adult schools and              correspondence courses.

Passage (4)              In its loosest sense, thinking signifies everything that, as we say, is \"in our heads\" or that \"goes through our minds\". He who offers a              \"penny for your thoughts\" does not expect to drive any great bargain. In calling the object of his demand 'thoughts', he does not              intend to ascribe to them–dignity, consecutiveness or truth. Any idle fancy, trivial recollection or flitting impression will satisfy his              demand. Daydreaming, building of castles in the air, that loose flux of casual and disconnected material that floats through our              minds in relaxed moments are, in this random sense, thinking. Now reflective thought is like this random coursing of things              through the mind in that it consists of a succession of things thought of ; but it is unlike, in that the mere chance occurrence of any              chance \"something or other\" in an irregular sequence does not suffice. Reflection involves not simply a sequence of ideas, but a              consequence – a consecutive ordering in such a way that each determines the next as its proper outcome, while each in turn leans              back upon its predecessor. The successive portions of the reflective thought grown out of one another and support one another;              they do not come and go in a medley. Each phase is a step from something to something, technically speaking, it is a term of              thought. Each term leaves a deposit which is utilized in the next term. The stream or flow becomes a train, chain or thread.

Passage (5)               Newspapers sell because of news and editorial coverage but it gets more revenue from advertisements. News costs money, while              advertisements fetch money. The  economics of modern newspapers is such that it cannot run by just selling news; it has to depend              on advertisements. The economics of newspaper publishing requires both subscribers who can afford to buy newspapers and              businessmen who can afford to advertise in it. The growth of the press depends on both. Therefore in newspaper management              neither aspect can be neglected. Co-ordination among the various departments–editorial, circulation, advertising and production              is very essential for effective and better management. The head of various departments must be part of the management of a              newspaper. They must be aware of the goals set, policies and future plans of the management. They cannot afford to remain cut off              from the mainstream of management function. In addition, each department managers must be informed of those of its activities              that will be useful to them. This is a vital aspect of newspaper management.

Business sense dictates that we guard our capital and live from the interest. Nature's capital is the enormous              diversity of living things. Without it we can not feed ourselves, cure ourselves of illness or provide industry with the raw materials              of wealth creation. Only 150 plant species have ever been widely cultivated. Yet over 75,000 edible plants are known in the wild.              In a hungry world, with a population growing by 90 million each year, so much wasted potential is tragic. Medicines from the wild              are worth around 40 billion dollars a year. Over 5000 species are known to yield chemicals with cancer fighting potential.              Scientists currently estimate that the total number of species in the world is between 10–30 million with only around 1.4 million              identified. The web of life is torn when mankind exploits natural resources in short-sighted ways. The trade in tropical hardwoods              can destroy whole forests to extract just a few commercially attractive specimens. Bad agricultural practice triggers 24 billion              tonnes of top soil erosion a year losing the equivalent of 9 million tonnes of grain output. Cutting this kind of unsuitable              exploitation and instituting \"sustainable utilization\" will help turn the environmental crisis around.

Owing to a few reasons, there are many contradictory              estimates available. The first reason is that at and after the time of dropping of these bombs, there prevailed such a situation of              havoc that taking an account of dead bodies was impossible. The second reason is that most of the atom bomb survivors were, later              on, plagued by various health disorders commonly known as 'radiation-disease' or the 'atomic disease'. The radiation continued              taking its toll for quite a long time. All the deaths caused by the radiation disease could not be recorded in the category because              many of the victims did not disclose the fact of their being atom bomb survivors to avoid discrimination in their social life. The              third reason is that the deaths of army-personnel were not included in these death accounts. further more, the Allied Occupation              Forces in September 1945, had banned release of any information concerning the atom bomb and even research on its effect was              restricted. At present, there are about four lac persons in Japan who survived the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They are              called 'Hibakusha'. In the Japanese language, this term means the persons affected by the atom bomb or to put it precisely 'the atom              bomb survivors'.                                                                    27","Help box – dispute =  to contend for, to argue; contradictory =  mutually opposed or inconsistent; prevail =  to gain mastery over, to              be prominent; havoc =  destruction, devastation; plague =  pestilence, trouble, moral corruption; radiation =  diffusion of rays of              light; discrimination =  discernment , judgement; further more =  moreover; release =  to set free, to discharge; restrict =  to confine,              to restrain within bounds; survive =  to live beyond the life of, to out live; precise =  exact, accurate.

There seems to be no reason for this. We still go              on eating and loving the pleasure of the palate but I imagine that half the confectioners would go out of business if no one under              thirty were allowed to eat sweets. There are a hundred greedy sweet-eaters under the age of thirty for one above it. You seldom see              a middle-aged man peering with a rapt expression into a confectioner's window. His eyes may goggle before a cake shop,              especially in France but he seldom gazes at a sweet shop as if a vision of heaven had been spread before him. Indifferent to sweets              as I am, I know a man of my own age who can eat chocolates even while he is drinking whisky and soda. Women, too, nibble              sweets after dinner. But they do not get really excited about them as the young do. I do not know a single woman who would shout              with joy if you offered her a sugar mouse. The sight of a chocolate Easter egg with a sugar hen sitting on it does not send the adult              into raptures. Pass round a bagful of acid drops among your friends and see how many of them will thank you. I sometimes wonder              whether our later tastes for tobacco, beer, wine and whisky are sufficient compensation for our loss of the appetite for sweets. So              one cannot feel the same excitement of choice in a cigarette-shop or a public house as one once felt in a sweet-shop.

(a)  There are a hundred sweet-eaters under the age of thirty for one above it.                  (b)  The pleasure of the palate no longer appeals to us.

Which reason among the following does the writer not give for non-liking of sweets among persons above thirty?                  (a)  He, himself, is indifferent to sweets.                  (b)  The women do not get really excited about sweets.                  (c)  The sight of a chocolate Easter egg with a sugar hen sitting on it does not send the adult into raptures.

Religion seemed to give a permanent and even an honoured place to poverty and misery in this world. The              promises and rewards of religion were all for some other world; here we were told to bear our lot with resignation and not to seek              any fundamental change. Charity was encouraged, the giving of crumbs to the poor, but there was no idea of doing away with              poverty or with a system which resulted in poverty. The very ideas of liberty and equality were opposed to the authoritarian              outlook of the church and society. Democracy did not, of course say that all men were, in fact, equal. It could not say this because it              is obvious enough that there are inequalities which result in some being stronger than others, mental inequalities which are seen in              some people being abler or wiser than others and moral inequalities which make some unselfish and others not so. Many of these              inequalities are due to different kinds of upbringing and education or want of education which make a vast deal of difference.

(b)  These were the common and inevitable lot of man.                 (c)  These were made by the Gods.            (d)  These were created by the people themselves .               2.  How have poverty and misery been treated in religion?                 (a)  These have been given a permanent and honoured place.                 (b)  These have been discarded.                 (c)  These have been abhorred in religion.                 (d)  These have not enjoyed any place.               3.  What does religion tell us?

Passage (10)               It may be asked, \"In what respect do speeches differ from a pamphlet or magazine article?\" There is an essential difference. Speech              has a human element lacking in the written word because speech is communication between the speaker and his audience face to              face. This fact should be ever present to the speaker's mind both when preparing and delivering the speech. People addressed each              other by word of mouth long before they wrote. Speech, therefore, is more primitive and human than written matter. Public              speaking not only admits but demands characteristics which would be blemishes in compositions intended to be read. The attention              of the audience must be held, arguments repeated and free use made of analogies and illustrations. For this reason good speakers are              often bad writers and good writers are rarely effective speakers. A speech is a transitory, evanescent, episodic production depending              for its immediate effect not only upon the matter but upon the delivery which enables the great speaker to sway his hearers. From              their point of view personality is the thing that counts for most. In written compositions it stands for little or nothing. The quality of              written word is the only thing that matters. The author may be repulsive but he is invisible. He looks at you only through the printed              page. The speaker is judged by what he is or what he appears to be. No man can achieve wide distinction as a speaker unless he can              impress an audience face to face. That is the acid test of oratory, high or low. That is how the speaker makes his reputation.               Help box – pamphlet =  a small unbound book treating current topics; essential =  vital; element =  essential part; lack =  want, to be              in want; communication =  act of imparting news, information given; audience =  interview, meeting, hearers; primitive =  ancient,              original; blemish =  stain; analogy =  likeness, similarity; illustration =  explanatory picture; evanescent =  quickly disappearing,              fleeing; transitory =  short-staying; sway =  to swing, to rule; repulsive =  forbiddig, offering resistance.              Questions :               1.  What according to the author is the difference between speech and a magazine article?                  (a)  Speech is less effective than the article.                  (b)  Speech can do more wonders than an article.                  (c)  Speech has a human element lacking in the written word.

Although the British retained supreme authority of India              till 1947, the provincial elections of 1937 provided real exercise in democratic practice before national independence. After              independence, India was faced with two vast problems, the first, that of ethnic diversity and the aspirations of subnationalities. The              Congress leadership was more aware of the former problem than of the second; as a new political elite which has rebelled not only              against the British Raj but also against India's social order, they were conscious of the need to initiate economic development and              undertake social reforms, but as nationalists who had led a struggle against alien rule on behold of all parts of India, they took the              cohesion of the Indian nation too much for granted and underestimated the centrifugal forces of ethnic division, which were bound              to be accentuated rather than diminished as the popular masses were more and more drawn into politics. And it was only in              response to strong pressures from below that the principle of linguistic states was conceded as the basis of a federal 'Indian Union'.

Questions :               1.  Which of the following problems was India facing after independence?                  (a)  military attack from across the border                  (b)  lack of co-ordination between the central and state governments                  (c)  improper co-ordination of various government policies                  (d)  increasing the production from a very low level               2.

(b)  India was capable of bringing into practice the ideas of democracy.                  (c)  Supremacy of British in India was likely to be short lived.

We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. Man              continually wages war on them, for they contaminate his food, carry diseases or devour his crops. They sting or bite without              provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights or beat against our lighted windows. We live in dread not              only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless ones like moths. Reading about them increases our              understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing              to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch.              No matter how much we like honey or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we              have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable but they are difficult to erase. At the same time, however,              insects are strangely fascinating, we enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they              lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware of our presence.

Delhi tourism and social welfare minister S.P. Ratawal said at a press conference here today that the              thrust of the scheme will be settlement of beggars particularly children in social welfare homes wherein training will be imparted              to make the beggars earn a decent living. He said that whereas the government will act tough against the beggars seen loitering at              road-junctions, the humanitarian aspect of the problem will not be overlooked, \"We will make efforts to involve social activists              and other voluntary organisations in this task\", he said while hinting that a composite programme of rehabilitation of beggars may              be undertaken by involving big business houses in this endeavour. He stated that the government would soon undertake an              extensive exercise to prepare a time-bound 'action plan' for tourism in Delhi. \"Discussions will be held with travel trade, eminent              citizens of the capital and also those involved in other activities connected with arts and culture,\" he said.

These activities are not only opposed to morality but also to law and if the legal objection can be added              to the moral, the argument against the use and the manufacture of these weapons will considerably be enforced. Now the time is              ripe to evaluate the responsibility of scientists who knowingly use their expertise for the construction of such weapons which have              deleterious effect on mankind. To this must be added the fact that more than 50% of the skilled scientific man- power in the world              is now engaged in the armament industry. How appropriate it is that all this valuable skill should be devoted to the manufacture of              weapons of death in a world of poverty? This is a question that must touch the scientific conscience. A meeting of biologists on the              long term world wide biological consequences of nuclear war added frightening dimensions to those forecasts. Its report              suggested that the long biological effects resulting from climatic changes may at least be as serious as the immediate ones. Sub-              freezing temperatures, low light levels and high doze of ionizing and ultraviolet radiation extending for many months after a large              scale nuclear war could destroy the biological support systems of civilization.

Questions :               1.  The author's most important objective of writing the above passage is to :                  (a)  highlight the use of nuclear weapons as an effective population control measure.                  (b)  illustrate the devastating effects of use of nuclear weapons on mankind.                  (c)  summarize the long biological effects of use of nuclear weapons.                  (d)  highlight the supremacy of the nations which possess nuclear weapons.               2.  The scientists possessing expertise in manufacturing destructive weapons are :                  (a)  few in number.                  (b)  irresponsible and incompetent.                  (c)  more than half of the total number.                  (d)  engaged in the armaments industry against their desire.               3.  According to the passage the argument against the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons :                  (a)  does not stand the test of legality.                  (b)  is acceptable only on moral grounds.                  (c)  becomes stronger if legal and moral considerations are combined.                  (d)  possess legal strength although it does not have moral standing.               4.  It appears from the passage that the use of the nuclear weapons is considered against morality by:                  (a)  almost all the nations of the world.                  (b)  a minority group of scientists.                  (c)  only the super powers which can afford to manufacture and sell weapons.                  (d)  only such nations which cannot afford to manufacture weapons.               5.  Which of the following best explains the word 'devoted' as used in the passage?                 (a)  dedicated for a good cause              (b)  overutilized for betterment                 (c)  underutilized                            (d)  abused for destruction                                                              Passage (5)               Inter-caste marriages are becoming more and more acceptable since 1940s. Thanks to change in the caste and family systems and              rise in education, occupational mobility, women's economic independence and urbanisation. Studies show, 'Inter-marriage',              between people belonging to different cultures or sub-cultures, has been gaining momentum in recent decades, according to              seasoned sociologist Ram Ahuja, a senior fellow at the ICSSR and author of a recent book 'Indian Social system' covering various              facts of life in the country. The cultural groups can be religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or geographical while the sub-cultures can              be Shias and Sunnies, Catholics and Protestants or castes and sub-castes, he says and adds that these marriages involve the              sociological problem of assimilation and adjustment. What kind of people go in for inter-marriages, Mr. Ahuja divides the types of              people who marry outside their castes into eight categories- \"the accultured, the emancipated, the adventurous,  the rebellious, the              marginal, the promiscuous, the detached and the demoralised person\".  And the reasons are- \"Residential propinquity, cultural              similarity, close association and common experiences, recreational contacts, education in public schools, urbanisation and              industrialisation\" he says.                                                                    33","Help box –  occupation =  a holding on employment, pursuit; mobility =  fickleness, changeability; Urban =  pertaining to the city or              town, polished; momentum =  impetus gained by a body in motion; ethnic =  pertaining to race; assimilate =  to compare with, to              absorb into the system; emancipate =  to free from restraint, to set at liberty; rebellious =  engaged in a rebellion; margin =  border,              reserved amount; promiscuous =  mingled, indiscriminate; propinquity =  nearness in time, close kinship; detached =  isolated.              Questions :               1.  Which among the following is not a reason for inter-caste marriages?                 (a)  rise in education                        (b)  women's economic independence                 (c)  cultural dissimilarity                   (d)  urbanization               2.  What type of marriages face problem of adjustment? Marriages based on :                 (a)  recreational contact                     (b)  residential propinquity                 (c)  sub-cultures                             (d)  close association               3.

Their              followers try to feed the body on earth and to save soul from perdition after death; but they neglected the claims of the mind. Bread              for the body and virtue for the soul; these are regarded as the indispensable requisites of human welfare here and hereafter.              Nothing is said about knowledge and education. Thus Jesus Christ spoke much of feeding the hungry, healing the sick and              converting the sinners; but he never taught the duty of teaching the ignorant and increasing scientific knowledge. He himself was              not  a  well-educated  man  and  intellectual  pursuits  were  beyond  his  horizon.  Gautam  Buddha  also  laid  stress  on  morality,              meditation and asceticism but he did not attach great importance to history, science, art or literature. St. Ambrose deprecated              scientific studies and wrote, \"To discuss the nature and position of the earth does not help us in our hope for life to come\". St. Basil              said very frankly and foolishly, \"It is not a matter of interest for us whether the earth is a sphere or a cylinder or  a disc\". Thomas              Carliyle also followed the christian traditions when he declared that he honoured only two men and no third; the manual labour and              the religious teacher. He forgot the scientist, the scholar and the artist. The cynics of Greece despised education. To them virtue              was the only good.

Questions :               1.  The religious teachers, since the remote past down to the present times, have neglected :                 (a)  soul.             (b)  science.          (c)  intellect.                (d)  body.               2.  What has Christ neglected in his teachings?

What does St. Basil say about scientific studies?                 (a)  That they are baseless.                 (b)  That they help us much.                 (c)  That they can't help in spiritual elevation.    (d)  That they enlighten us.               5.  Whom did Thomas Carlyle honour more than others?

Almost all of us suffered from a headache at some time or the other. For some a headache is a              constant companion and life can be a painful hell of wasted time. The most important step to cope with headaches is to identify the              type of headache one is suffering from. In tension headache (two-hand headache), a feeling of a tight band around the head exists              along with pain in the neck and shoulders. It usually follows activities such as long stretches of driving, typing or sitting on the              desk. They are usually short-timed, but can last for days or weeks. A headache is usually caused due to spinal misalignment of the              head, due to poor posture. Sleeping on the stomach with the head turned to one side and bending over positions for a long time              make it worse.                 In migraine headaches (one-hand headache) the pain is usually on one side of the head and may be accompanied by nausea,              vomiting, irritability and bright spots or flashes of light. This headache is made worse by activity, especially bending. The              throbbing pain in the head gets worse by noise and light. Certain triggers for migraines may be chocolate, caffeine or smoking. The              pain may last from 8 to 24 hours and there may be a hangover for two-three days. Migraines are often preceded by an ''aura\"-              changes in sight and sensation. There is usually a family history of migraine.               Help box – cope =  to contend evenly with, to encounter; stretch =  to lengthen, to tighten, to exert to the utmost; spinal =  of the back              bone; nausea =  feeling of sickness, loathing; irritability =  susceptibility to irritation; flash =  to break into flame suddenly; throb =  a              beat of palpitation; hang =  droop or bend; preceded =  to become or go before time.              Questions :               1.  According to author, for whom can life be a painful hell?                  (a)  Who are not physically fit.                  (b)  Who work harder than others.                  (c)  Who have stretches of driving, typing or sitting on the desk.                  (d)  Who have a constant headache.               2.  When does a feeling of a tight band around the head occurs?                 (a)  in migraine headaches                    (b)  in tension headaches                 (c)  when one suffers from nausea            (d)  where there is a lot of noise               3.

But men have lived amongst the mountains since pre-historic times and              in some parts of the world, as in the Andes and Himalayas, difficult mountain journeys have inevitably been part of their everyday              life. However, some of the peaks were easily accessible from most of the cities of Europe. It is quite interesting that while modern              mountaineers prefer difficult routes for the greater enjoyment of sport, the early climbers looked for the easiest ones, for the              summit was the prize they all set their eyes on. Popular interest in mountaineering increased considerably after the ascent of the              Alpine peak of Matterhorn in 1865 and Edward Whymper's dramatic account of the climb and fatal accident which occurred              during the descent. In the risky sport of mountaineering the element of competition between either individuals or teams is totally              absent. Rather one can say that the competition is between the team and the peaks themselves. The individuals making up a party              must climb together as a team, for they depend upon one another for their safety. Mountaineering can be dangerous unless              reasonable precautions are taken. However, the majority of fatal accidents happen to parties which are inexperienced or not              properly equipped.

Questions :               1.  Mountaineering is different from other sports because :                 (a)  it can be fatal.                        (b)  it is thrilling and exciting.                 (c)  there is no competition between individuals.    (d)  it is risky and dangerous.                                                                   35","2.  People living in the Andes and the Himalayas made mountain journeys because :                 (a)  they lived in pre-historic times.       (b)  of the challenge offered by the difficult journey.                 (c)  it was kind of sport.                   (d)  they had to undertake them in their day-to-day life.               3.  Mountaineers climb as a team because :                 (a)  there is no competition among them.     (b)  the competition is between the team and the peak.                 (c)  the height is too much for one individual.    (d)  they have to rely on each other for safety.               4.  \"The summit was the prize they all set their eyes on.\" In the context of the passage this means :                  (a)  they kept their eyes steadily on reaching the peak.                  (b)  reaching the top was their exclusive concern.                  (c)  they chose a route from which they could see the summit clearly.                  (d)  they cared for nothing but the prize of reaching the summit.               5.  What is the adjective form of the word 'inevitably'?                 (a)  inevitability     (b)  inevitableness    (c)  inevitably                (d)  inevitable                                                               Passage (9)              How you can best improve your English depends on where you live and particularly on whether or not you live in an English              speaking community. If you hear English spoken everyday and mix freely with English speaking people, that is on the whole, an              advantage. On the other hand, it is often confusing to have the whole language, poured over you at once. Ideally, a step-by-step              course should accompany or lead up to this experience. It will also help a great deal if you can easily get the sort of English books in              which you are interested. To read a lot is essential. It is stupid not to venture outside the examination 'set books' or the text books              you have chosen for intensive study. Read as many books in English as you can, not as a duty but for pleasure. Do not choose the              most difficult books you find, with the idea of listing and learning as many new words as possible; choose what is likely to interest              you and be sure in advance that it is not too hard. It is extensive and not intensive reading that normally helps you to get interested              in extra-reading and thereby improves your English. You should enjoy the feeling which extensive reading gives of having some              command of the language.

Questions :               1.  According to the author which among the following is a wrong method for improving your English?                 (a)  to have the whole language poured over you    (b)  to live in an English speaking community                 (c)  to read many books for pleasure         (d)  to choose books not too hard               2.  What is the author's point of view about reading?                 (a)  to read a lot is not essential          (b)  to read as many books in English as you can, as a duty                 (c)  to choose the most difficult books      (d)  to choose what is likely to interest you               3.  What is not true about extensive reading?                  (a)  not to venture outside the examination 'set books' or the text books                  (b)  to get interest in extra reading                  (c)  to feel the enjoyment of having some command of the language by reading                  (d)  not to have an idea of learning as many new words as possible               4.

A successful business man does              nothing to increase his popularity by being careful with his money. He is expected to display his success, to have a smart car, an              expensive life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean and his reputation in business may even              suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that if he had not been careful with his money in the first place, he would never have              achieved his present wealth.                 Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk who makes his wife, a present of a new dress              when he hasn't paid his house-rent is condemned as extravagant, carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as                                                                   36","a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her              housekeeping money into joyless little piles– so much for rent, for  food, for the children's shoes; she is able to face the milkman              with equanimity every month, satisfied with her economising ways and never knows the guilt of buying something she can't really              afford. As for myself, I fall into neither of these categories. If I have money to spare, I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually              the case, I am hard up, I am the meanest man imaginable.

Questions :               1.  In the opinion of the writer, a successful businessman :                 (a)  should not bother about popularity.     (b)  is expected to have expensive tastes.                 (c)  is more popular if he appears to be doing nothing.    (d) must be extravagant before achieving success.               2.  It seems that low paid people should :                 (a)  feel guilty if they overspend.          (b)  borrow money to meet their essential needs.                 (c)  not keep their creditors waiting.       (d)  not pay their bills promptly.               3.  How does the housewife feel when she saves money?                 (a)  She wishes she could sometimes be extravagant.   (b)  She is still troubled by a sense of guilt.                 (c)  She wishes life were less burdensome.    (d)  She is content to be so thrifty.               4.  As far as money is concerned, we get the impression that the writer :                 (a)  does not often have any money to save.    (b)  would like to be considered extravagant.                 (c)  is never inclined to be extravagant.    (d)  is incapable of saving anything.               5.  The word 'paradox' in the fifth sentence of the passage means :                 (a)  statement based on the popular opinion.    (b)  statement which is contrary to received opinion.                 (c)  statement based on facts.               (d)  statement which brings out the inner meaning.                                                      3.

Passage (1)              When I was twenty years old I had my first long trip. With an older friend, I visited the south island of New Zealand. One of our              plans was to spend two days at a famous tourist resort, \"The Hermitage\", right in the heart of the giant peak of the southern Alps.              We had a magnificent drive through the mountains and arrived at the Hermitage in the early afternoon. It was a perfect day and the              great peaks around seemed to tower over our heads. I looked on them with a growing feeling of excitement – the great rock walls,              the hanging glaciers and the avalanche-strewn slopes. And then strangely, stirred by it all I felt restless for action and decided to go              for a walk. I set off towards the Sealy Range, which I could see high up, behind the hotel. I soon realized it was much farther than I              had judged, but for some reason I kept going on and soon with an astonishing sense of achievement I climbed back down the long              slopes to the Hermitage. That evening, as I sat in the lounge, I felt restless and excited. And then the hum of voices suddenly hushed              and I looked up to see two young men coming into the room. They were fit and tanned, they had an unmistakable air of competence              about them. I could hear a whisper going around the room, \"They've just climbed Mount Crook\". And soon they were the centre of              an admiring group.                                                                                                          by– Edmund Hillary               Help box –  magnificent =  pompous, excellent; giant =  demon, demon-like; avalanche =  mass of snow, mud, etc. which slips from              a mountain; glacier =  a river of ice; slope =  slanting surface, declivity; strew =  to scatter on surface, to cover with small objects; stir              = to move, to set in motion, to agitate;  to set off = to mark, start off, to show in relief;  astonishing = amazing;  hum = to make              murmuring sound; hush =  silence, stillness; tan =  brown; whisper =  to speak under the breath, to prompt secretly.

Which among the following is not true about the environment which surrounded the resort?                 (a)  There were giant peaks around it.       (b)  It was surrounded by the hanging glaciers.                 (c)  There were avalanche-strewn slopes.     (d)  There was Sealy Range in front of the hotel.               3.  The two young men coming into the room were :                 (a)  thin and tall.                           (b)  handsome but fat.                 (c)  healthy but aggressive.

And yet I think it is undeniable that as a batsman the Indian will live as the supreme exponent of the English man's              game. The claim does not rest simply on his achievements, although, judged by them, the claim could be sustained. His season's              average of 87 with a total of over 3, 000 runs, is easily the high-water mark of English cricket. Thrice he has totalled over 3,000              runs and no one else has equalled that record. And is not his astonishing achievement of scoring two double centuries in a single              match on a single day– not against a feeble attack, but against Yorkshire, always the most resolute and resourceful of bowling              teams?                 But we do not judge a cricketer so much by the runs he gets as by the way he gets them. \"In literature as in finance\", says              Washington Irving, \"much paper and much poverty may co-exist.\" And in cricket, too, many runs and much dullness may be              associated. If cricket is menaced with creeping paralysis, it  is  because it is losing the spirit of joyous adventure and becoming a              mere instrument for compiling tables of averages. There are dull mechanic fellows who turn out runs with as little emotion as a              machine turns out pins. There is no colour, no enthusiasm, no character in their play. Cricket is not an adventure to them; it is a              business.                                                                                                        by – A.G.

Questions :               1.  Which among following is incorrect regarding K.S. Ranjit's scores?                  (a)  His season's average is 87 with a total of over 3,000 runs.                  (b)  Twice he has totalled over 3,000 runs.                  (c)  He scored two double centuries in a single match on a single day.                  (d)  He scored double centuries against Yorkshire.               2.  He is considered supreme exponent of the English man's game because :                 (a)  his achievements are many.                   (b)                       he is better known to the world of             cricket as Ranji.                 (c)  no one else has equalled his records.    (d)  of the way he gets runs.               3.  Cricket is menaced with creeping paralysis, which reason among following is not responsible?                  (a)  Because it is losing the spirit of joyous adventure.                  (b)  Because it is a mere instrument for compiling tables of averages.                  (c)  Because there are dull, mechanic fellows who turn out runs with little emotion.                  (d)  Because there is an association between runs and enthusiasms.               4.  What is the meaning of the word 'feeble' as used in the context of the passage?

A sound mind in a sound body are prerequisites for high efficiency and good              quality work in the office, factory or field which lead to a sense of achievement and fulfilment. Our health is, of course, important              not only to us, but also to our families and even to our employers. No wonder then that employers have a stake in the health and              fitness of their employees and are willing to spend considerable money towards this purpose. Japanese companies particularly              excel in this and the more successful among them start the day off with a body bending and stretching session and even singing the              company song designed to promote loyalty and motivation among the work force. This is considered an important factor              contributing to high productivity and quality. Here is a lesson which has been emulated elsewhere in the world and could work              wonders in India. It is estimated that some 20,000 American firms have established in-house health clubs. Such expenditure has              proved to be a wise investment in achieving better efficiency and higher productivity. It has indirectly also  helped reduce the              premium on the health insurance of its staff.

I tried to rise but I was not able to move, for my legs and arms were fastened to the ground on each side. My hair, which              was long and thick, was tied down in the same way, so that I could not even turn my head. All at once, I heard a strange sound near              me, then I felt something moving along my left leg. Over my chest it came and right up to my chin, When I looked, I saw a little man,              not more than six inches high, with a bow and arrows in his hand. Behind him came forty other tiny men like him. I was so surprised              that I cried aloud and pulled my left arm free from the cords that tied it.

One prepared to receive professors. With              what pleasure one bought new books! One felt as if one were setting out on a Journey. It is one of the great pleasures of a student's              life to buy a heap of books at the beginning of the autumn. Here, he opens each of them impartially with pleasure; he enjoys the very              'feel' of the paper, the smoothness or roughness of the covers, the look of the title-page.

The fresh, white              pages that no thumb had sullied attracted me possibly as a symbol of a new beginning, a dawn, a spring. Now I would rise from my              past as from sleep, put on 'the new man', as the preachers say, and set out on a career of tireless discovery. I would plunge into the              beautiful waters of learning and emerge a scholar.

Yet, I think that at almost any              time in recorded history an Indian would have felt more or less at home in any part of India, and would have felt as a stranger, an              alien in any other country. He would certainly have felt less of a stranger in countries which had partly adopted his culture or              religion. Those who professed a religion of non-Indian origin and coming to India settled down there, became distinctively Indian              in the course of a few generations, such as Christians, Jews, Parsis, Moslems ; Indian converts to some of these religions never              ceased to be Indian in spite of a change of faith.

The profession has a              great and honourable tradition, extending from the dawn of history until recent times, but any teacher in the modern world who              allows himself to be inspired by the ideals of his predecessors, is likely to be made sharply aware that it is not his function to teach              what he thinks, but to instil such beliefs and prejudices as are thought useful by his employers. In former days a teacher was              expected to be a man of exceptional knowledge or wisdom, to whose words men would do well to attend. In antiquity, teachers              were not an organized profession and no control was exercised over what they taught. It is true that they were often punished              afterwards for their subversive doctrines. Socrates was put to death and Plato is said to have been thrown into prison, but such              incidents did not interfere with the spread of their doctrines.

Some people live in luxury without doing any work, whilst others work from morning till evening with no rest or              leisure and yet they have not the barest necessities of life. This cannot be right. It is the negation of justice. It is not the fault of our              individuals who happen to be rich. It is the fault of the system and it is up to us to change this system which permits exploitation of              man by man and produces so much misery. Our country can produce enough to permit every man and woman living in it to live in              comfort and peace. Every man and woman must have the opportunity to develop to the best of his or her ability. But to do so we              shall have to forget some of our ideas of a bygone age. Honour and merit must come from ability and hard work and not because of              caste or birth or riches. Let each one of us consider the other as his brother, not the higher or the lower, neither to be worshiped nor              despised, but treated as having equal rights to share all this good country of ours produces.

Now, it is accurate to refer to poets as dreamers, but it is not              discerning to infer, as this person did, that the dreams of poets have no practical value beyond the realm of literary diversion. The              truth is that poets are just as practical as people who build bridges or look into microscopes; and just as close to reality and truth.              Where they differ from the logician and the scientist is in the temporal sense alone; they are ahead of their time, whereas logicians              and scientists are abreast of their time. We must not be so superficial that we fail to discern the practicableness of dreams. Dreams              are the sunrise streamers heralding a new day of scientific progress, another forward surge. Every forward step man takes in any              field of life, is first taken along the dreamy paths of imagination. Robert Fulton did not discover his steamboat with full steam up,              straining at a hawser at some Hudson river dock, first he dreamed the steamboat, he and other dreamers, and then scientific              wisdom converted a picture in the mind into a reality of steel and wood. He who looks deeply and with a seeing eye into the poetry              of yesterday finds there all the cold scientific magic of today.                                                                                                           by – Glen Falls               Help box – discern =  to distinguish difference, to perceive clearly; infer =  to deduce, to conclude; realm =  royal jurisdiction,              domain; diversion =  a turning aside from any course, pastime; temporal =  pertaining to the time in this life or this world, secular;              abreast = side by side, keeping in a line;  superficial = pertaining to the surface, not profound;  streamer = a ribbon attached at one              end with the other end waving in the air, a beam of light; herald =  a state-officer who makes proclamations and bears messages, a              forerunner; surge =  a large wave, a swelling undulation; hawser =  the large rope of a ship; strain =  to make the greatest possible              effort.              Questions :               1.  Which among the following is not true about poets according to the author?                 (a)  The poets are dreamers.                 (b)  The poets are practical.                 (c)  The poets are close to reality and truth.    (d)  They do not differ from the scientists.               2.

(c)  The dreams are the streamers heralding a new day of scientific progress.                  (d)  The dreams have no practical value.               3.  To prove that the poets are practical, the author compares them with :                 (a)  doctors.          (b)  scientists.       (c)  builders.                 (d)  magicians.               4.

Passage (1)              From time immemorial man must have looked at the clear night sky and wondered what the heavenly objects were supposed to be.              He must have compared and contrasted their appearance with that of the sun during the day. From where does the sun appear in the              east and where does it go in the west? Why do most bodies move round a northerly direction, the direction of the Pole Star, whereas              a few exceptional ones seem to move in irregular ways? Why is the moon, which apparently is of comparable size to the sun,              considerably less bright than the sun? These questions must have occurred to the curious among the mankind in the past. Now,              there is a tendency in the human mind to ascribe strange natural phenomena to supernatural causes. This tendency runs counter to              the scientific approach which is born out of curiosity and thrives on a critical assessment. We see an excellent example of the two              tendencies in man's approach to the motion of heavenly bodies. The questions raised above could not be answered straight way              and so the former tendency was dominant. It is not surprising, therefore, that man ascribed supernatural powers to sun, the moon              and the stars.                                                                                                         by – J.V.

(d)  when man ascribed supernatural powers to the sun, the moon and the stars .               3.  Which tendency was most dominant among men?

As I was here airing myself on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of human life; and              passing from one thought to another, 'surely', said I, 'man is but a shadow, and life a dream'. Whilst I was thus musing, I cast my              eyes towards the summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a little musical              instrument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The sound of it was exceedingly              sweet and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressible, melodious and altogether different from anything I had ever              heard. They put me in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to the departed souls of good men upon their first arrival in              paradise, to wear out the impressions of their last agonies, and qualify them for the pleasures of that happy place.

This has been proved by all medical researches that worry is a              major cause of heart ailments, blood pressure, rheumatism, ulcers, skin problems, asthma and many other psychosomatic              diseases. Dr Alexis Carrel, a Nobel prize winner in medicine, said, \"Businessmen who do not know how to fight worry die young\".              But so do a lot of home-makers, lawyers and ordinary clerks who do not control this evil.                 There are several causes of worries. The fast-paced and complicated life style that most people are leading today contributes              largely to our anxieties, shortages, fears, competitions, dissatisfaction – everything adds to the burden on our minds. Some of these              factors may be uncontrolled but most of them are within our control.                 Plato, the Greek Philosopher had foreseen this need as far back as 400 BC. He had said, \"The greatest mistake physicians make              is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind. Mind and body are one and should not be treated              separately.\" This was the basis that laid the foundation-stone of the modern psychosomatic treatment. So emotions like futility,              frustration, anxiety, worry, fear, despair, defeat, etc are negative emotions. These affect much our mental as well as physical health.              Worry especially, creates a very high degree of tension. Only a cool and worryless mind functions normally and to its capacity.                                                                                              by – Tanushree Podder (adapted)               Help box – research =  a careful inquiry, a critical investigation; ailment =  disease, pain; rheumatism =  gout; several =  separate,              consisting of a number; psychosis =  mental derangement; pace =  step, to walk; complicated =  complex; contribute =  to pay a              share, to bring about; anxiety =  worry; attempt =  to make an endeavour, to attack; cure =  to heal, to restore, remedy; treat =  to              behave towards, to manage; basis =  made to lie down, brought forth an egg; capacity =  holding power, capability; futility =              worthlessness.

The couple who saw her off were probably her parents; they              seemed very anxious about her comfort, and the woman gave the girl detailed instructions as to where to keep her things, when not              to lean out of the windows, and how to avoid speaking to strangers. They said their good byes; the train pulled out of the station. As              I was totally blind at the time, my eyes sensitive only to light and darkness. I was unable to tell what the girl looked like; but I knew              she wore slippers from the way they slapped against her heels. It would take me some time to discover something about her looks,              and perhaps I never would. But I liked the sound of her voice and even the sound of her slippers.              \"Are you going all the way to Dehra?\" I asked. I must have been sitting in a dark corner, because my voice startled her. She gave a              little exclamation and said, \"I didn't know anyone else was here.\" Well, it often happens that people with good eyesight fail to see              what is right in front of them. They have too much to take in, I suppose. Whereas people who cannot see have to take in only the              essentials, whatever registers most tellingly on their remaining senses. \"I didn't see you either,\" I said, \"But I heard you come in.\" I              wondered if I would be able to prevent her from discovering that I was blind, I thought. \"Provided I keep to my seat, it shouldn't be              too difficult.\"                                                                                                         by – Ruskin Bond               Help box – probably =  perhaps, possibly; anxious =  worried; lean =  to bend, to incline for support; pull out =  depart; slap=  (adverb)              hastily, effectively; startle =  to move suddenly, to frighten or shock; register =  to record (in a register); remaining =  what remains;              essential = vital;  exclamation = outcry;  provided = on condition that.               Questions :               1.  The parents of the girl were very anxious about her comfort. Which among following sentences does not show it?                 (a)  Her mother told her the right place to keep things.   (b) Her mother asked her not to lean out of the window.                 (c)  Her parents said their good-byes.       (d)  The mother asked her not to speak to strangers.               2.  Why did the author's voice startle her? Because :                 (a)  he asked her \"Are you going all the way to Dehra?\"   (b) he must have been sitting in a dark corner.                 (c)  she failed to see what is right in front of her.    (d)  she didn't known anyone else was here.               3.  How would the author be able to hide his blindness from the girl?                 (a)  He would not tell her that he was blind.    (b)  He would keep to his seat.                 (c)  He would not interact her much.         (d)  He would sit in the dark corner.               4.  What is the meaning of the word 'register' as used in the context of the passage?

(a)  province          (b)  provincial        (c)  provincialize             (d)  provincially                                                              Passage (5)              You seemed at first to take no notice of your school-fellows, or rather to set yourself against them, because they were strangers to              you. They knew as little of you as you did of them; so that this would have been a reason for their keeping aloof from you as well,              which you would have felt as a hardship. Learn never to conceive a prejudice against others because you known nothing of them. It              is bad reasoning and makes enemies of half the world. Do not think ill of them till they behave ill to you and then strive to avoid the              faults which you see in them. This will disarm their hostility sooner than pique or resentment or complaint. I thought you were              disposed to criticize the dress of some of the boys as not so good as your own, Never despise anyone for anything that he can not              help–least of all , for his poverty. I would wish you to keep up appearances yourself as a defience against the idle sneers of the              world, but I would not have you value yourself upon them. I hope you will neither be the dupe nor victim of vulgar prejudices.              Instead of saying above, I might have said, \"Never despise anyone at all\";  for contempt implies triumph over and pleasure in the ill              of another. It means that you are glad and congratulate yourself on their failings or misfortunes.                                                                                                        by – William Hazlit                                                                    47","Help box – aloof =  away, at a distance; conceive =  to imagine; prejudice =  bias, partiality; enemy =  an opponent, a hostile person;              disarm = to deprive of arms, to render defenceless;  strive = to struggle, to try hard;  pique = ill-will, resentment;  hostility = enmity,              opposition; dispose =  to arrange, to finish; despise =  to look down upon, to disdain; dupe =  a victim of deception; sneer =  jeer,              scornful smile; vulgar =  rude, unrefined; imply =  to involve the truth of, to mean; contempt =  hate; triumph =  the state of being              victorious.

(b)  it will make enemies of half the world.                 (c)  they think ill of you.                  (d)  they find faults in you.               2.

For what should you strive according to the author?                 (a)  You should never hate anyone.           (b)  You should never dislike the dress of others.                 (c)  You should avoid the faults of others.    (d)  You should feel pleasure in the ill of another.               4.

Now, we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so              conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of              that field, as a final resting place for those who, here, gave their lives so the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that              we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, cannot hollow this ground. The bravemen,              living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor              long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the              unfinished work, which, they who fought here, have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great              task remaining before us that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause that these dead shall not have died              in vain–that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom–and that government of the people, by the people, for the              people, shall not perish from the earth.                                                                                                     by – Abraham Lincoln               Help box – continent =  a mainland; proposition =  formal statement, a sentence in which something is affirment or denied; endure =              to remain firm, to bear; consecrate =  to set apart as sacred, to sanctify; hollow =  empty, excavated; detract =  to take away, to              defame; perish =  to suffer destruction, to come to an end.               Questions :               1.  The new nation followed the conception of :                 (a)  equal rights to all.    (b)  freedom to all.    (c)  liberty and equality.    (d)  individuality.               2.  Why did Lincoln call the nation's power as poor power?                  (a)  Because they are financially poor.                  (b)  Because their army is not strong.                  (c)  Because they cannot add or detract the importance of the strugglers–living or dead.                  (d)  Because their ground is small in size.               3.  How does Lincoln remember the brave soldiers?                  (a)  by telling the people to forget what they did there                  (b)  by having a dedication to the great task remaining before them                  (c)  by consecrating the ground                  (d)  by having a power to add or detract the portion of that battle field               4.

The result of this is that the conscious mind gets no rest from a certain small number of matters, each              of which probably involves some anxiety and some element of worry. Except in sleep, the conscious mind is never allowed to lie              fallow while subconscious thought matures its gradual wisdom. The result is excitability, lack of sagacity, irritability and a loss of              sense of proportion. All these are both causes and effects of fatigue. As a man gets more tired, his external interests fade, and  as              they fade he loses the relief which they afford him and becomes still more tired. This vicious circle is only too apt to end in a break              down. What is restful about external interests is the fact that they do not call for any action. Making decisions and exercising              volition are very fatiguing, specially if they have to be done hurriedly and without the help of the subconscious.                                                                                                      by – Bertrand Russell                Help box – fatigue =  weariness from exertion; conscious =  aware, knowing; fallow =  uncultivated; sagacity =  quickness of              discernment; irritable =  easily irritated or made angry; proportion =  symmetry, equality of ratios between two pairs of qualities;              apt = appropriate, suitable;  volition = the act of willing, the power of determining.              Questions :               1.  What is the principal cause of fatigue according to the author?                 (a)  to do an uninteresting job              (b)  inability to find a job of his interest                 (c)  giving no importance to his own life    (d)  having less sleep               2.  What is true about the subconscious mind?                  (a)  It never stops functioning except in sleep.                  (b)  It keeps on working even more vigorously in sleep.                  (c)  It feels fatigue in doing job of no interest.                  (d)  It gets no rest from a certain small number of matters.               3.  Why do some people become highly irritable?                  (a)  Because they are forced to do a job which is not of their liking.                  (b)  Because they work from morning till night.                  (c)  Because they are highly ambitious.                  (d)  Because they have no practical values.               4.  What is the meaning of the word 'gradual' as used in the context of the passage?                 (a)  progressive       (b)  slowly            (c)  fast                      (d)  lacking               5.  What is the adjective form of the word 'excitability'?                 (a)  excitation        (b)  excitant          (c)  excite                    (d)  excitement                                                              Passage (8)               That great conqueror and destroyer Genghis Khan once asked his courtiers what was the greatest pleasure in life. He listened to a              number of conventional replies and then answered his own question. 'The greatest pleasure in life, he said, is to defeat your              enemies, to chase them before you and rob them of their wealth, and to see those dear to them bathed in tears'. All forms of conflict              have an overspill of irrational violence. A revolutionary movement whose manifest aim is benign is quite likely to end by killing a              number of innocent people whose sole crime is having been born into the wrong social group. Both mobs and disciplined soldiers              can be carried away by the excitement of combat and indulge in pillage, arson, etc. It is reasonable to ask at this point why, if the              correct aggressive action for survival is some kind of reward, flight is not similarly rewarded, because presumably it is as likely to              be the correct solution as aggression. The answer is, of course, that it is. Fear and anxiety are unpleasant emotions, similar to pain,              and when their cause is removed we feel relieved. But these danger signals are being pumped out automatically on receipt of              information.                                                                                                      by – Shelford Bidwell               Help box– conqueror =  one who conquers, a victor; destroyer =  one who annihilates; conflict =  fight, struggle; spill =  to run out of              a vessel, to throw away; irrational =  illogical, void of understanding; revolutionary =  an instigator of a revolution; manifest =              evident, obvious; benign =  fortunate, kind; combat =  to contest, to fight; indulge =  to entertain, to allow one self; pillage =  plunder;              arson = wilfully burning a house;  aggressive = making the first attack;  presumable = what may be supposed as true.

The devil, I take it, is still the busiest creature in the universe, and I can quite imagine him denouncing              laziness and becoming angry at the smallest waste of time. In his kingdom, I will wager, nobody is allowed to do nothing not even              for a single afternoon. The world, we all freely admit, is in a muddle; but I for one do not think that it is laziness that has brought it to              such a pass. It is not the active virtues that it lacks but the passive ones; it is capable of anything but kindness and a little steady              thought. There is still plenty of energy in the world but most of it is simply misdirected. If, for example, in July 1914, when there              was some capital idling weather, everybody, emperors, kings, archdukes, statesmen, generals, journalists, had been suddenly              smitten with an intense desire to do nothing, just to hang about in the sunshine and consume tobacco, then we should all have been              much better off than we are now. But no, the doctrine of the strenuous life still went unchallenged, there must be no time wasted,              something must be done.                                                                                                         by – J.B.

They forget that very few people would              work at all if it were not for the money their work brings them, and that without work there would be no money. And they have even              imagined that if all the money in the country were equally divided, everybody would be rich. Now that is a very great mistake,              because there simply is not enough money to make everybody rich. If it were shared equally all round everyone then would, on the              basis of the calculations made in 1935, receive only about `65 a year. Today with a rise in the price level it might be `150 a year.              That may be more than you receive now or it may be less, but would certainly not make you really rich. It is quite true that there are              in this country a small number of very rich people but they are so few in comparison with the whole population that even if they              were to share out all their wealth among the rest, it would make very little difference. Besides; don't ever imagine that there is              anything to be ashamed of, or anything undignified to grumble about in having to work hard for your living.                                                                    50","by – Ernest F.

It may be a letter, an article, a paragraph, story or a report, etc. The   G             most important thing is that a general idea of the  subject of these forms of writing should be in our minds so that we may             clearly  express  ourselves. A  composition  whether  short  or  long  should  always  be  compact  and  concise  without  any             unnecessary material. While writing such forms of writing we should keep to the context and should not stray from the             subject. The beginning, the body and the ending of these writings should be interlinked. While writing a letter we should             always try to make the salutation impressive and the ending very polite. While writing a paragraph, story or an article, there             should be a sequence of ideas and they should be interconnected to make a meaningful and perfect piece of writing.                                                        1.  LETTER WRITING                 We all have to write letters–whether we like it or not. There are pleasant ones – to congratulate, invite, book holidays, etc.             There are unhappy ones – expressing sympathy on a bereavement, cancelling a visit, etc.                 Whatever the occasion, you need the right words to produce the correct result. Successful letter writing is an art worth             cultivating. Every educated person should know how to write a clear and readable letter. We have to write many letters of one             kind or the other during our life time. Everyone has sometimes to write business letters of some sort that will vitally affect his             interests in life. Hence it is desirable to know what makes these letters interesting and attractive.                  The value of a good letter is great, both in business and in personal correspondence. The art of letter writing is, therefore,             no mere ornamental accomplishment, but something that every educated person must acquire for practical reasons. An ill-             constructed letter is like a badly made woman's dress. It may cover the essential points but is unlikely to produce the desired             effect. A good letter always impresses. It should be as simple in form and natural in style as if the writer were actually speaking             to the addressee.                  It is therefore, essential to learn not only the technique but also the art of writing letters through constant practice. The             style of letters should be adapted to the person and the subject. When we have to write business letters, we should be polite and             clever but in personal letters, we should be sincere and humble. While writing to children, we should be affectionate and             loving but to superiors, we should be respectful. While dealing with important matters, the letter should be impressive and             effective, but while writing on the lighter topics, the style should be light and flowing.                  Some other hints are– It should be like a conversation being done. It should have a perfect beginning for, as a building             with defective foundations will collapse, a body with brittle bones is crippled, in the same way a letter which lacks a good start             may prove disastrous. If you are penning a passionate letter of love, you may ignore the rules– but there are those who think             that even passion requires literate expression, in sensible form. The ordinary letter writer also needs to knock his words into             proper shape. Take care with the construction of your letter. Be courteous, avoid hackneyed phrases, bad punctuation. Never             fail to date your letter. Write in a simple and clear language. Business letters should be short and to the point and official letters,             formal and dignified.                 Types of Letters                 There are two types of letters which have been prescribed in the syllabus for classes IX and X.                 1.   Informal or Personal Letters : The letters written between family members, relatives, friends, teachers and             students come into this category. These letters include notes on invitation, condolence, birthdays, ceremonies, anniversaries,             congratulations on appointments, requests and so on.                 2.  Formal Letters :  These letters include notes on complaints, enquiry, applications, offering suggestions or making             requests. These letters are written to the principals for jobs, businessmen, government officials, editors of newspapers and so on.                  So there are different types of letters, each of which has its own particular form, but there are certain matter of form which             apply to all and to neglect them is a sign of ignorance and carelessness. In all kinds of letters there are six points which are             common.                  Parts of a Letter                 1.  Heading :   Heading consists of two parts –                     (a)  Address of the writer :  It includes the writer's address. Nowadays it is written at the top left hand corner of the             page, and if the address consists of several parts, each parts can be written in separate line and no comma is used after each line.             For example–                     'The House'                     15 – R, Briar Road                     Haryana                                                                   61","(b) Date :  Never forget to insert the date of the day on which you write a letter. You may do so in many ways. All the             following are in common use–                  13th January, 2010, January 13th, 2010, 13th Jan. 2010, January 13,2010 or 13 January 2010. Do not write 13-1-2010 or             13 /1/2010 or 13/1/2010. As Americans put the month before the day, for them it means March 1, 2010. Always remember that the             day is written in figures, month in words and year in full. Insert (,) comma if you write the date in figure just before the year. The date             should appear under the address.                  This heading will inform the reader where you wrote the letter and when. The reader may reply you on the given address, and             the date tells him the exact day on which you wrote the letter, so that he might guess that he got the letter in time or it is delayed due to             some reason and he would be able to give you quick response, if there is a need and the letter is of 'urgent' nature.                 2.  Salutation or Greeting : It is the complimentary greeting to the person to whom the letter is being addressed. It is a formal             way of beginning a letter. It is written at the left hand of the first page, at a lower level than the heading. Its first letter and the first letter             of the last word is written in capital letters if there are more than two words. The form of Greeting depends upon the relation and the             intimacy between the two–the writer and to whom it is being addressed. Nowadays no comma is inserted after the salutation. The use             of the term 'Dear' is purely formal and is a mere polite expression, not necessarily implying any special affection.                  For example– in personal letters :                  (a)  To Blood relations older than the writer                     My dear Father / Mother or Dearest Father                     My dear Brother / Sister or Dearest Brother                     My dear Uncle / Aunt or Dear Uncle / Cousin                     Respected Aunt / Uncle                  (b)  To Younger Relations                     My dear Ankita or Dear Ankita                  (c)  To Friends                     My dear Anurag or Dear Anurag or Dear Shri Anurag.                      You should not write My dear Friend.                  (d)  To Acquaintances or Senior Friends                     Dear Mr. Gupta or My dear Sri Gupta or My dear sir                  (e)  To Strangers                     Dear Sir/Madam or Sir / Madam or Dear Mr / Dear Mrs.                  (f)  To One's Teacher / Principal / Head of Institutions                     Sir / Madam or Dear Sir / Madam or Respected Sir / Madam                  (g)  To Business men, Shopkeepers, Managers, Firm, Company, Book seller, etc.                      Dear Sir / Sirs/ Madam                  (h)  To Officials, Editors, Employers, Superintendent of Police, Post Masters                     Sir/Madam                  Note :  Never use two adjectives together. It is wrong to write– 'My dear respected Father'.                 3.  Body of the Letter or the Communication : It is the most important part of the letter rather letter itself. It is written in             three parts mainly. First, we should give the reason, Why we are writing this, then the main message and lastly the conclusion             containing a humble wish. The style of the letter should be according to the intimacy between the two, the lower the intimacy the             more formal it is. A business letter is totally different from a personal letter. The language should be simple and direct having short             sentences. Try to put down your points in some logical order. Write neatly so that the other might read it easily and grasp the same             meaning which you want to convey to him. Then, incorrect punctuation may alter the whole meaning of the sentence, so commas,             full stops should be used at their proper place. Thus it should be well arranged and divided into separate paragraphs unless it is very             short. Do not add postscript to formal letters.                  The introductory paragraph can be begun like this –                  (a)  For Personal Letters                      1.  I am fine here hoping the same for you .....                      2.  I am well here and hope that you will also be sailing in the same boat of life and time .....                      3.  I received your letter just now /last week/ on 24th May .....                      4.  Received your much awaited letter only yesterday .....                      5.  Thank you for your kind and affectionate letter .....                      6.  I was very glad / delighted to receive your letter .....                      7.  You will be glad to know that .....                      8.  Sorry I could not reply your letter in time due to .....                      9.  I was very sorry to hear the news that .....                     10.  It was really so kind of you .....                                                                    62","The first sentence should encourage the recipient to read on. The first impression should not be like this \"I'll read it when I get a             moment\" rather the impression should be – 'Ah, this is interesting'.                 (b)  For Business Letters                      1.  I shall be glad / obliged / delighted / pleased, if you kindly send me .....                      2.  Would you be kind enough to send me .....                      3.  May I draw your kind attention to .....                      4.  With due respect I want to state .....                      5.  We shall be very pleased to supply the goods you require .....                      6.  We are grateful to you for your courtesy .....                  (c)  For Official Letters and Applications                      1.  With humble and polite submission I beg / want to state .....                      2.  I have the honour to bring to your kind notice .....                      3.  With reference to your advertisement dated ..... in The Times of India .....                      4.  I read your advertisement and would be pleased to offer my services .....                  The second and more paragraphs are the substance of what you want to convey to the person to whom it is being addressed.                  Ending a letter :  Now, comes the final sentence. It is of great importance. It leaves the last impression on reader's mind. It can             be as follows –                  (a)  For Personal Letters                      1.  Convey my best wishes to elders and love to youngers.                      2.  With a lot of love / blessings / respects .....                      3.  With warm wishes / best regards .....                      4.  With kind / warm / affectionate regards .....                      5.  With heaps / bags of love .....                      6.  Wishing you all the best .....                      7.  Give my heartiest love to .....                      8.  With gratitude / good wishes .....                      9.  Reply soon / your reply is awaited .....                     10.  Awaiting your earliest possible response .....                  (b)  Business and Official Letters                      1.  Thanking you                      2.  Thanking you in anticipation                      3.  I hope you will reply me soon                      4.  You will favour me with an early reply                      5.  I shall leave no stone unturned, if I am given a chance                      6.  I shall try to rise up to your expectations .....                      7.  Would you please inform us immediately .....                      8.  I am grateful to you for your help and look forward to using your services again before long .....                 4.  The Subscription :  It is a courteous leave taking phrase. It should be written two lines below the main letter on the left             side of the page. It also depends upon the relation or intimacy between the two, the writer and the addressee. Only the first letter of             the phrase should be written in capital letter. Nowadays comma is not inserted after this phrase, so the letter must not end simply             with the writer's name. This would look odd and abrupt, so certain forms of polite leave taking are following according to the             relation –                     (a)  To Blood Relations : Yours affectionately/ Affectionately yours/ Yours affectionate/ Yours loving                     (b) To Friends : Your sincerely / Sincerely yours / Your ever/ Ever Yours/ Yours truly                     (c)  To Principal / Teacher : Yours faithfully / Yours sincerely / Yours obediently                     (d) To Strangers : Yours truly                     (e)  To Government Officials / businessmen / Editors of News papers, shopkeepers : Yours faithfully / Yours truely                     (f)  To Employers, from one official to another, complaints or requests to officials :  Yours faithfully                 Note:  (1) Sincerely should not be used in letters beginning with the formal Dear sir. It should be yours faithfully. Similarly                          Gratefully yours can be used only when a benefit has been received.                           (2)  You should not use apostrophe (') while writing yours. Nowadays no comma (,) is used after subscription.                 5.  The Signature or the Name of the Writer : It is the last part of the letter. The Writer should write his/her name below the             subscription. He / She can also show his / her designation too. While writing to strangers, the name should be clearly written, so that             he / she can reply properly only to you and to no one else. For ladies, Miss or Mrs, Km, Smt can be written in brackets like –                  Yours faithfully                  (Mrs) Kalpana Yadav                                                                     63","6.  The Address on the envelope :  The address is written on the envelope, postcard or on inland letter. It should be written             very clearly with the Pin code, so that the letter might reach to the addressee without delay. Nowadays no comma (') is used after any             line and the first letter of each word is written in capital, like following :                                                                                          Postal                                                                                      Stamp                                            To                                            Mrs Kalpana Yadav                                            G-105, Kalkaji                                            New Delhi                                                                    Pin Code-110 011                           Some points to Remember :                      1.  Do not use comma (,) after the salutation and subscription.                      2.  All friends and close relatives, younger to the writer should be addressed by their first names.                      3.  No apostrophe should be used for yours.                      4.  While writing a letter in the examination don't write your address or name, simply write as                         Examination Hall                         ABC City                         and sign as                         XYZ                      5.  While addressing to a lady use 'Madam' in place of 'Sir'.                      6.  For guided composition letters, certain guidelines are given. The students are required to conform to those points             while writing the body of the message. No point should be left out while composing the letter.                  About Postscript :  Sentences which are added to a letter after it has been written, completed and signed by the writer is called             postscript. It is written at the bottom left hand side of the letter. The two letters 'P.S.' are written for it. It should be avoided while             composing a letter.                                            (a) INFORMAL OR PERSONAL LETTERS                  These letters include letters written to relatives, parents, friends having a note on general happenings, congratulating them,             wishing them, inviting them, feeling sorry for something wrong, giving sympathy and for condolence. These letters are written to             relatives so a deep feeling of intimacy is but natural. So these should be written in a conversational style. The language should be easy             and flowing. These should be less formal and really of the nature of friendly chat. But this does not imply carelessness and ill-             composing. It must be remembered that however free and easy may be our style, we are bound by the rules of spelling, punctuation,             grammar and idioms.                  Rules for writing a friendly letter :  When you write a friendly letter to your relatives or friends, you should address him/her             with the name of the person to whom you are writing, prefixed by such qualifying terms as Dear, My dear, Dearest, etc. For example –             Dear Father / Mother, Dearest Sister, My dear Aakash and so on. But if you are writing to an older friend of superior rank, you should             use prefix like Mr, Mrs, Shri, etc. For example– Dear Mr Gupta. Similarly the forms of subscription should be used. While writing to             friends or relatives you should use – Yours affectionate/Sincerely yours, etc and this may be preceded by with kind / kindest regards             in case of addressing them as Shri, Mr or Mrs, with name. But Sincerely should not be used in letters beginning with the formal Dear             Sir without names, rather the proper word of subscription is faithfully or truly. Besides, as the aim of such letters is to bring news and             share a person's thoughts, ideas and experiences with his loved ones, so you should write in a style as if you are speaking to the             person. Use plain and simple language.                  (a)  Letters to Parents / Relatives / Friends ( for giving thanks to them )                     Here are some sample lines to start with :                      1.

It will be a pleasant surprise for you, and will                  remind you of my love and affection.

Write a letter to your mother describing her how you have fared in your                  annual examination.              Ans.   98-B, Brahampuri                   Gujarat                   9 May, 20XX                   My dear Mother                   At last I am relieved of the tension of my exams. You will be pleased to know that I have done all the papers to my complete                  satisfaction. I hope to secure more than ninety per cent marks. It is all due to the encouragement and advice I got from you time                  to time. Every subject was at my finger tips. I was terribly afraid about Physics and Mathematics. By the grace of God, I have                  done very well in both these subjects. I hope to get distinction in Chemistry. In English, too, I hope to get more than 85 marks.                  Some questions were difficult but I managed to attempt them very well. It was possible because I had thoroughly revised all                  the courses of study and had left nothing to chance. I also did well in Hindi and Social Science. The result will be declared by                  the end of  May or in the first week of June. I am confident that my performance will bring credit to you as well as my school.                                                                   70","With respect to dear father and love to Prachi                   Yours affectionately                   Kirti               21.

Write a letter to your father telling him that you could                  not do well in the pre-board examination.              Ans.   5, South Extension                   Vihar Chowk                   Punjab                   5 January, 20XX                   My dear father                   I am sorry to tell you that I could not do well in the pre-board examination. My progress report has been a cause of                  disappointment to you and family. But the reason was my sudden illness just before the examination. I studied hard but there                  was a need of revision which I could not do due to weakness. This I did not write to you earlier because I did not want to disturb                  you. I am not giving you a lame excuse. Kindly forgive me for not informing you about my illness. But now I am well and will                  work hard for annual examination by keeping an eye on my health too and will prove myself. You need not worry as I have                  sufficient time to revise all the courses of study. This time I will surely not let you down.                   With regards to dear Mumma and love to Nitu                   Yours affectionately                   Raghav                22.

Write a letter to your brother advising him to participate in games and                  other activities.

I think you are awfully busy with your studies and do not take part in games and other activities. You know that                  \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\" To be a bookworm is to invite some disease or other. The mind needs rest.                  Health is wealth. If your health is not good, you can't enjoy life. So you must have an all-round development. Games are as                  useful as studies. They make us active and mentally relaxed. They are a source of entertainment. So I would advise you to take                  part in games and other social and cultural activities. These activities have their own importance.                   I hope you will act upon my advice and give up over-work. Let studies and sports go side by side.                   Wishing you the best of  health                   Yours affectionately                   Puneet                 23.

I                  received the honour- a gold medal and two certificates by the Director of Public Institutions. He praised me a lot. My                  photograph appeared in local newspaper. I am enclosing a cutting of it. I could not confine this news to myself and wanted to                  share it with you because you are the person who would be proud of my achievement. In fact, the credit goes to you who                  always encouraged me to do something extraordinary. It is all due to your blessings and guidance. Mumma and Pinki will also                  be glad to know this. Give my regards to her and love to Pinki.                   Rest is O.K.

Write a letter to your younger brother telling him the uses of morning walk                  and balanced diet for keeping good health.

Your health is                  deteriorating . You should follow the two rules for maintaining good health.                   First you should go for a morning walk daily up to a distance to which you can easily go. For some time you should walk fast in                  a lawn bare footed. This will keep you fit and active throughout the day. This is the best and simple exercise for keeping fit and                  healthy.                   Secondly your meals should be plain and wholesome. Give more importance to green vegetables, fruits, milk, etc. Eat a bit                  less than your appetite.                   Moreover rest is also necessary. Whenever you are tired of your study, relax yourself. Always be cheerful.                   I hope you will agree with me. So follow this advice and be healthy.                   Yours affectionately                   Amit                 25.

Everyone admired the birthday cake. I hope they really relished it. There was a special program of music as I                  had hinted in my card. My sister Natasha played on her guitar, which added great colour to the party. We all danced a lot and                  then played a game too which was won by Abhay. My parents gifted me a beautiful camera. It was a fine evening spent with                  friends. I took photographs too. I am sending one for you, so that you may guess what a great fun it was to be dressed up in                  peculiar dresses. Besides you will also be able to see video recording when you come here.

I wish to write to you something about the elections of the students union of our college. It was                  very exciting. All the students had turned up that day. There were some outsiders too. I have never seen such a large crowd in                  the campus. Everyone was busy canvassing for the candidates for the offices of union president, secretary and treasures. Very                  innovative methods were used by the students to seek votes. There were free cold drinks and all signs of affection and                  friendship. There was much activity and excitement. There was some suspense too but it was soon over. The winning                  candidates were taken out in a procession with lot of singing and dancing. Thus the day was very colourful and interesting.                   Pay my regards to mother and love to Chinki.                   Yours affectionately                   Piyush                27.

I don't wonder you feel rather home-sick, for it is the first time you                  have been away from home and I, too, often want you home again but as you know we can't always have what we want in life.                  Our father thinks that a few years at a boarding school is necessary for all boys, to make men of them. So my dear brother, you                  must be brave. You are an intelligent and sincere boy and you will tide over the initial difficulties and adjust yourself to the                  new surroundings. You must keep patience and avoid irritation over trifles. Devote time to studies. Be gentle and courteous.                  Make new friends. Don't mind the jokes if others play on you. They will soon get tired of teasing you. These steps will                  certainly help you to overcome unhappiness and will attract your classmates towards you.

Kashmir is a beautiful place. Its                  beauty is beyond description. During our visit the sky was cloudless. We lived in a house-boat all the time. I spent my time                  fruitfully, in a charming way– fishing,bathing,walking and trekking. The nature was at its best. The climate was cool and                  bracing. I visited Wuler lake, Dal lake, Gulmarg, Nishat Garden and many other places. The short stay gave us a good                  opportunity for cultural exchange. It definitely proved itself a paradise on earth. I enjoyed a lot and tried to capture its beauty                  in my camera.

It was played between our school team and the District Football Association.                  Every team was zealous for winning the trophy. The players showed remarkable footwork. They gave short passes. The                  onlookers enjoyed the brisk handling of the ball. The game had not long begun, before the referee had to turn off one of the                  players of our team for foul play. The team protested, the crowd roared and things looked ugly, but soon they settled down. The                  fun began when the referee awarded our team a penalty kick by which we scored a goal and we won the trophy, we shouted                  'hip-hip hooray'.                                                                   73","Rest is well.

Write a letter to your cousin describing her the good and bad points of                  your school as she wants to take admission in your school.              Ans.   91, Chanakya Puri                   Rajasthan                   3 April, 20XX                   My dear Ankur                   I received your letter. I am glad to know that you are interested in taking admission in our school, the most popular school in                  this town. Our school is situated in the heart of city. It is a double storeyed building. It has expansive playgrounds. The                  teachers are hard working, sincere and experienced. They put in their best and show illustrious results. The students of our                  school secure topmost positions in the board examination.                   But I regret to tell you that in spite of the vast playgrounds the students are not encouraged to take part in games. Ours is a                  result-oriented school. As excess of every thing is bad. In our school much stress is laid on showing results. Moral, cultural                  and physical aspects of education are neglected. Only a few selected students are allowed to take part in extra-curricular                  activities. I think these help a lot in making one fully educated.                   Rest is well. Pay my regards to uncle and aunty and love to Ritu.                   Yours affectionately                   Shristi                32.  To Friend– About examination hall                   You are Dewansh living at 25, Chanakya Puri, Allahabad. Write a letter to your friend Amrit describing your experience in the                  examination hall.              Ans.  25, Chanakya Puri                   Allahabad                   3 March, 20XX                   My dear Amrit                   My examinations are now over. I was very nervous in the examination hall when this was my first paper. My heart was beating                  fast. I felt a little relaxed when I saw my classmates there and exchanged a few words. I mustered up courage and sat on my                  allotted seat. The warning bell rang and the question papers were handed over to the invigilators. After five minutes the                  second bell rang and the question papers were now distributed to each of us. I read the question paper patiently and felt much                  comfortable this time as all the questions were on my finger tips. There was no difficulty. I started answering them one by one                  in an easy mood with confidence. My all nervousness disappeared. There was arrangement of water. I took a glass or two                  whenever I felt thirsty. The invigilators were very strict, so there was quite silence in the hall. Suddenly the principal along                  with some of the members of the flying squad came into our hall. They searched each one of us but everything was right. No                  one was caught using unfair means and copying. Meanwhile the time was over and I was able to answer all the questions in the                  allotted time. I returned the questions paper to the invigilator and left the hall in a happy mood. I felt if one is fully prepared,                  there is no need of worry at all. Rest is well.                   With love                   Yours truly                   Dewansh                33.

There are four seasons. All the                  seasons have their own charm. Spring, the queen of all seasons, comprises the two months of March and April. You may visit                  India in these two months. You need not to bring woollen clothes. Delhi  is the capital of India. During your stay in Delhi we                  may visit Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Jama Masjid, Birla Temple, Raj Ghat, Zoo, Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Shanti                  Van, Humayun's Tomb, etc. We may go to Agra to see the Taj and visit Jaipur, the pink city and so on. There are many other                  places and monuments of great architectural and cultural importance in other cities too, which we may discuss later after your                  arrival. There are many worth seeing beaches too, as India is surrounded by water on three sides.                   So confirm your visit and intimate me accordingly. My family is also eager to see you.                                                                   74","With love                   Yours sincerely                   Mohit               34.  To Friend– Wishing to take commerce not science                   You are Pulkit living at 8, Zuhu Beach, Mumbai. Write a letter to your friend Narang telling him that you want to opt for                  commerce.              Ans.  8, Zuhu Beach                   Mumbai                   11 August, 20XX                   My dear Narang                   You are very close friend of mine. So I may tell you everything and can share my innermost feelings. This time I want to tell                  you that I have preferred Commerce to Science and Arts for some personal reasons. The reason is that I have no aptitude for                  Science. It appears to me dry and dull. As far as Arts faculty is concerned, my father has objected to it firmly. Commerce, I                  think, will be suitable for me, for I am to settle down ultimately in my father's business which is on a very large scale. The                  knowledge of accounts and commercial  law will prove useful in giving great practical help to me in this. So I intend to join the                  Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi. After that I want to appear in the CAT. If I get through it successfully, I may do my                  MBA from Ahmedabad which would be a best option open to me to continue my studies. I hope I will be admitted to this                  institution of world fame.                   One cannot ignore the merits of higher education. It broadens one's mental horizons and opens up new avenues and business                  possibilities. A degree in this will certainly go a long way in helping me to do better in business .                   You should also take an independent decision suited to your taste and means.                   With best wishes                   Yours sincerely                   Pulkit                 35.  To Friend– About Diwali celebration                   Write a letter to your friend, Bhuwan insisting him to celebrate Diwali without crackers. You are Nitish living at 82,                  Dariyagunj, New Delhi.              Ans.  82, Dariyaganj                   New Delhi                   7 Oct, 20XX                   My dear Bhuwan                   The festival of lights is on 25th of October. That is the day when crackers burst and rockets soar. Do you remember the last                  Diwali we celebrated together? It was four years back. It is one of the happiest days in my memory. Seema who cried for                  crackers that day is now grown up. She is five feet four inches now. I still remember how the rockets we fired, pierced the                  window pane of Mr. Malhotra's house. Your brother threw lighted crackers at passers-by. We spent the whole night bursting                  crackers. But both of us are grown-ups now. We are able to know that sometimes these crackers prove quite dangerous. Many                  people lose their eye-sight. Their loud burst impairs the hearing power. There is much noise and air-pollution due to these                  crackers. So in my opinion this is a sheer wastage of hard-earned money to buy crackers. I have decided not to display the                  crackers on Diwali in future, I also advice you to celebrate Diwali without crackers. Celebrate this Diwali by purchasing new                  clothes, utensils, sweets, dry fruits and other things of use, as there is no other festival equal to it in the world. You may also                  exchange gifts with your relatives. I hope my advice goes home to you.                   Yours Sincerely                   Nitish                36.

When I set out from my                  house, I met with an accident on the road. While trying to save the life of a kid, I was thrown off my scooter.

I shall be discharged tomorrow but I will                  have to lie on bed for a couple of months or so.                                                                    75","Kindly pay my regards to respected uncle and give my love to Ankita.

I describe one such                  marriage held a week ago in my neighbourhood. You will now be curious enough to know so I put a full stop on your curiosity.                   As usual, it was held in the bride's father's house. The bride groom's party having nearly 100 persons arrived at 7 p.m. and was                  given a warm though formal welcome. The bride's father and relatives greeted them. Then they were served tea and sweets,                  etc.                   The actual ceremony was held in a big pandal decorated with flowers and multi-coloured electric lamps. The bride and                  bridegroom exchanged garlands. Then the groom sat by the side of bride and recited the mantras uttered by the priest while the                  ceremony was going on. All the invited guests were treated to a sumptuous dinner. Most of the guests then left. The bride and                  bridegroom, then, took seven rounds of the pious fire. The function passed on throughout night quite smoothly. Then, in the                  morning the bride was given an emotional farewell. The bride groom's party then left for the groom's house. Everyone                  enjoyed a lot. I think now you will have got a first hand knowledge of Hindu marriage ceremony.                   With hopes to meet you soon                   Yours sincerely                   Nishant               38.

Read history too.                   You should also engage yourself in extra- curricular activities. It will relieve you of the fatigue of daily life. Study the arts and                  literature.

(b) FORMAL LETTERS                   Formal or Public letters are those letters which we write to people who are not our relatives or friends. These letters are usually             short, precise and are written in simple language. These letters include :                  1.  Business or Commercial Letters                  2.  Official Letters                  3.  Letters to the Editor                  4.  Applications                                                                     78","Business or Commercial Letters                  Business or commercial letters include letters making enquiries or requests, complaints, placing orders, offering suggestions             and so on. Nowadays it is of great practical importance to know about business letters. In the words of Mr Herbert N. Casson - \"A             good letter is a master key that opens locked doors. It opens markets. It opens the way for your goods or services.\" So a business letter             must be correct in form, concise and to the point. It must convey the  message clearly. The style of a business letter is totally different             from that of a personal letter. As you are writing a letter which he will have to read, absorb and take action on during his very busy             office hours and it is very important that he should understand atonce what you want him to know or to do. So a business letter should             be terse, clear and to the point. A good business letter sells goods, creates new customers, brings back lost customers, gives             incentives to dealers, collects debts, settles old disputes, brings confidence in buyers and helps explore new markets.                 Parts of a Business letter :  A business letter is generally divided into the following parts :                     1.  The Heading :  It is usually written, typed or printed at the left hand corner. It comprises of the postal address of the writer                      and the telephone and telegraphic address. The address is followed by the date on which it is written as in a personal letter,                      just below the address. Some companies and firms use printed letter heads.                     2.  Inside Address :  The name and address of the firm or businessman to whom the letter is addressed should be written on the                      first page, lower down than the heading and to the left of the page. This corresponds with the address on the envelope. This                      is not required in the personal letters.                     3.  The Use of Messrs (M/S):  Messrs is normally prefixed to a company's name that includes the name (s) of a person or                      persons, otherwise it is not used as following :                  (i)  To a Tradesman                      Shri D.C. Prakash                      Shopkeeper                      54, Vaishnov Marg                      Jammu                 (ii)  To a Firm                      (a)  Messrs Vishnu Das \& Co.                    (b)   Messrs Ratnakar and Sons Ltd.                      Tea Merchants                      5, Ring Road                      Hyderabad                  Note: If the firm has an impersonal title, Messrs should not be prefixed.                  For example– The Pink City Cables Ltd, The Dhan Lakshmi Publishing House, etc.                 (iii)  To Professional men                      Mr. R. Bhatnagar                      Lawyer                      Patiyala House                      Chandigarh                 (iv)  Subject :  It is written before salutation and is placed in the centre of the page. This should clearly be indicative of the                     purpose of the letter.                 (v)  The Salutation : It is written on the left hand side of a letter. The most common forms are–  Dear Sir, Dear Sirs or Madam. If                     the person is known to you, you can address him by name as- Dear Mr. Singhal.                 (vi)  Body of the Letter :  This contains the message or information which the writer wants to communicate. If the matter is short                     and refers to one item only a single paragraph is sufficient. But if several matters are to be dealt with, separate paragraphs                     should be made for different items. It should be written logically to present the facts in the best possible manner.                (vii)  The Conclusion : The last paragraph should be forceful and convincing as it sums up the entire contents of the letter in a                     couple of lines. If the information to be supplied is lengthy, it may be given as an enclosure. Mention that the list is                     enclosed. You may use the words 'End' at the end of the letter and give the subject of enclosures, For example–                      Encl :    1. Cheque No. _______________                             2. Xerox copy of the bills received.                (viii)  The Subscription: The salutation and the subscription should conform to each other in manner, wording and style. 'Sir' and                     'Yours sincerely', do not go well with each other, whereas, 'Dear Sri Desai' and 'Yours very truly' blend well. In very formal                     letters you may use 'Yours respectfully' or 'yours obediently.' But if you have used a personal name in the salutation, the                     subscription should be 'Yours sincerely'.                 (ix)  The Signature : There is a requirement of the full signature in the formal letters. Below the signature the name and the                     position of the person are written or typed.                  Note: In business correspondence, while expressing the firm's views on any subject, the first person plural 'We' is used. First                      person singular is used when the correspondent is the owner of the business or is expressing his personal views.                      Occasionally very formal letters are written in third person too.                                                                    79","Some Model Letters                1.

We have been receiving our posts and                  parcels very irregularly for about last two months. The postman for delivering mails is Mr. Prem Nath. He needs pulling up                  and being strictly warned. Please note that such delay is very annoying. We are unable to despatch all the replies in time and in                  many cases we have suffered a heavy loss.                   Sometimes the postman on duty gives letters to the children playing outside. A public servant cannot be so irresponsible as to                  throw letters carelessly instead of putting them in the letter box installed at the main gate.                   We hope the concerned gentleman will be brought to book and be instructed to be regular and responsible.

There are pits and holes in the roads which are a threat to the vehicle drivers. The flow of water in the drains is not                  smooth. The drains stink badly. There are pools of water here and there where the streets are not pacca. These pools are a                  traffic hazard. The streets are not broomed for months. The garbage and rubbish is not removed for a number of days. This                  produces a group of hovering flies which are carriers of dysentry. The stagnant water breeds mosquitoes, the carriers of                  malaria, dangue and yellow fever. So there is a danger of epidemic breaking out in the locality. The situation can be worse as                  mansoon is near.                   Would you be kind enough to visit this area and instruct your staff to get the sanitary condition improved at war footing.                   With hopes for your early attention.

The                  reasons are many. On the internal roads, there are no street lights. The street lights are in a state of non-function. Then there is                  power-failure for long hours in the evening in addition to the scheduled power cut. Due to this students cannot study at night.                  There are mishappenings like purse-stealing, chain-snatching and many other anti-social activities like theft, etc. Darkness                  adds to the danger on streets. At home also life is totally out of gear. We have made frequent complaints to the local electrical                  officials but in vain.

They use                  them as extension to their shops where they hoard and display their wares and park their vehicles. The problem arose when a                  few transporters started to use these public footpaths as personal property. Everybody thought that it would be a temporary                  phase but gradually it became their habit and these footpaths became overcrowded due to their illegal possession. This poses a                  major problem to the pedestrians who are forced to move on to the roads which are meant for vehicles.                   I sincerely request you to take immediate steps to curb the menace and to get the footpaths be vacated so that life of the                  pedestrians may move on smoothly.                   Yours faithfully                   Avinash                15.  To Commissioner of Traffic Police– About underage driving                   You are Abhinav Chaturvedi of B-137, Ratna Apartments, Chandigarh. Write a letter to the Commissioner of traffic police                  complaining him against the underage driving which leads to injuries, mishaps and undue accidents.

The young children drive their vehicles in speed without caring for the traffic rules. In the process they,                  themselves get hurt or cause accidents to others. Their rash driving is objectionable. Because their over-enthusiasm for speed                  leads to mis-happenings. Injuries causing death due to underage driving are being reported frequently, and since no action is                  taken against these defaulters, this habit is getting developed among them very fast.                   I think that exemplary punishment should be given to these young drivers for throwing caution to winds, for hitting persons                  carelessly and for breaking traffic rules ruthlessly. It will give a positive message to these underage drivers as well as their                  parents.                   Yours faithfully                   Abhinav Chaturvedi                16.

There has been a sudden rise in the incidents of violence, chain-snatching, pick-pocketing, thefts of scooters and                  bicycles, extorting money from the people, teasing women, abusing and threatening them and so on. Such news appear almost                  daily in the newspaper. Anti-social elements have become so bold that they roam freely without any fear of being caught and                  punished. Nobody can dare to face them or to fight them. Many complaints have been lodged with the area police. However,                  no steps have been taken till now. We are genuinely concerned about this pathetic situation.                   It has become necessary that these unsocial elements be caught and drastic measures be taken against them to cope with the                  deteriorating situation of law and order in the city.

To the Police Commissioner– About pick-pocketing in the buses                   You are Shikha living at 309/B, Nehru Park, Saharanpur. While travelling in a daily route bus you found that a gang of pick-                  pockets freely boarded the bus and robbed the passengers.

They get into the buses and get off freely wherever they want. They are fearless. Bus drivers and                  conductors may also be a part of the plan because they stop the bus on some unscheduled stoppages. Some courageous                  persons object to it but of no use. The gang threatens the passengers to keep quite. So travelling in these buses has become very                  risky. They can be more harmful if opposed. The lives of the passengers are also at stake while travelling by bus.                   I request you to take remedial steps to identify and arrest the members of this notorious gang and punish them to restore the                  faith of the people in the law and order.

Some criminal activities like theft,                  kidnapping and murders are happening frequently in our colony. They are fully armed people having long knives, fire-arms,                  etc, so there is a danger to the lives of the residents also who remain always scared of them. We have a doubt that some servants                  working in the houses of colony are involved in such heinous crimes. They may have a hand and glove with the anti-social                  elements. Many complaints have been made to the nearest Police station but the culprits are still at large.                   As a suggestion to this problem, servants willing to work at houses may have a registration with the police and people should                  engage them after verification from the local police station.                   We hope that you will take an immediate step to curb the menace so that we may feel  relaxed.

I am a regular customer of this branch. I have observed recently that the staff  has become irregular. The employees do not start                  working at 10.am. exactly. The customers, who are punctual, suffer a lot due to this delay as they have to reach their                  destinations too in time. Delay in transactions causes a lot of troubles. Last week, I had to wait for one full hour to get my                  cheque cleared. Inquiries are not attended to properly and sometimes, necessary forms and papers are also not available.

When I went                  there to attend a routine school function, I noticed that there were long queues of twenty students before the water cooler.                  Nowadays this is scorching heat and there is a need of more coolers to provide the sufficient supply of water. Some students                  were bound to quench their thirst from the water taps.                   I think, supply of clean and germ-free water is a facility the school must provide for.

Although this park, developed by the M.C.D.                  is quite big, but nothing is being done for its maintenance for the last one year. This looks like a desert as there is no permanent                  gardener to manage it. Five out of eight benches are broken. The games meant for children are also not in a good position.                   The parks are called 'The lungs of a town'. They provide fresh air and a playing ground for children. Elders can also spend their                  morning and evening in the open air and do exercises in a friendly environment.

It is a matter of                  serious concern that the viewers of this channel are now less interested in watching its programmes.

The bulbs in the houses of the colony give light                  not more than the flicker of a candle. Students cannot study in this poor light. The guardians are worried. Entertainment on                  T.V. and radio is disrupted in the middle of the programme. Moreover, the frequent voltage drop is a great danger to other                  electrical appliances as well.                   The reason is that a number of new houses have come up in this area, resulting in an increase of residents, the use of electricity                  and hence the load has increased considerably.

If your community faces problem like water scarcity, power failure, etc. such problems can be brought to the notice of the                                                                    94","officials concerned, through the columns of newspapers. Appeals for help also appear in the letter columns in newspapers. If any             public organization does injustice to anyone, or a public servant is indifferent to one's grievances, one can write a letter to the editor             stating the problems, but whatever you write in such letters, should be true.                  Rules for Writing–                 The letters are addressed to 'The Editor'. The salutation should be Sir/Dear Sir. The subscription is generally 'Yours faithfully' or             'Yours truly'. If the writer gives his address for publication, it is often placed below the letter and to the left of the signature. If the             writer doesn't want his name to be published, he may request the editor to withhold it or publish only a pseudonym, like \"A sufferer\"             or 'one who knows' etc, may also be used at the end of the letter. The name of the writer need not be given at the end. But in any case he             must give his name and address (in a covering letter) to the editor, for no respectable newspaper will publish anonymous letters.                 A letter without the signature and full address of the writer, will be rejected. The letters should not be superfluous.

In such case  your opinion will be considered authoritative by the editor.                                                        SOME MODEL LETTERS               1.  About bad condition of water supply                   Write a letter to the Editor, The Hindustan Times, complaining against the bad condition of water supply in the town.

The residents hardly get water for an hour in the morning and half an hour in                  the evening, that too, has been irregular for the past one month. On some days there is no water supply at all. The pressure of                  water is very low. It takes 5 minutes to fill one bucket. Long queues and petty quarrels can be seen at every public taps.                  Besides, for a fortnight I have noticed a foul smell in the drinking water from the municipal tap. Some cases of vomiting and                  loose motions have also been reported. Many complaints have been made but they have fallen on the deaf ears of the                  concerned authority. If no steps are taken immediately to deal with the situation, the people will come out on the streets to                  protest.

About irregular power supply                   Write a letter to the Editor, The Times of India, complaining against the irregular power supply in your locality.              Ans.   7/2, Mayur Vihar, Delhi                   5 May, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Times of India, New Delhi                   Sir,                   Subject : About irregular power supply                   Through the columns of your esteemed daily I would like to draw the attention of the authorities of Hydel department                  regarding irregular power supply in Mayur Vihar. The Government has recently announced that power will be supplied                  regularly at least for 18 hours per day. But there is a frequent failure of electricity in our area. Either there is low voltage or                  complete break down for hours together. Shopkeepers, housewives and students all suffer due to it. It is examination time, but                  the children can't study, we can't sleep at night. During these hot days it has become very difficult to live comfortably. At night                  the market and the streets are totally dark and there are frequent thefts. The concerned authorties should look into the matter                  atonce otherwise the people of this locality will not bear this situation anymore. They may go to demonstrations and strikes.                  The position may be even worse. I hope the authorities will take an immediate action to remove the hardships faced by the                  people of this locality and we will find a quick solution at your hands.

About hazard of stray cattle                   Write a letter to the Editor 'The Indian Express' describing the hazard of stray cattle on the roads.                                                                    95","Ans.

Cows,                  dogs, pigs, etc are seen moving here and there on the busy roads.                   There is a dairy inside each block. Everyday in the morning, the owners let them loose to feed for themselves. The cattle roam                  around the main roads and the streets. They create a nuisance by making the roads dirty. They are also a traffic hazard, as they                  often sit down in the middle of the road. This obstructs the traffic and may lead to accidents. They even enter the houses or the                  parks and eat the grass. They even block the lanes for throughout the day until they are taken back by the dairy owners.                   So I would like to request the concerned authorities to identify the owners of these stray animals and take action against them.                  The removal of the cattle would lead to a more beautiful and cleaner Kalkaji.                   Yours truly                   Sapna Mittal                4.  About  repair of a road                   Write a letter to the Editor of a Newspaper about a piece of road that is in need of urgent repair.              Ans.   301, Ring Road                   Dehradun                   28 Feb, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Times of India                   Sir,                   Subject : Repair of a road                   Our Municipality wants waking up and as private appeals to their office have had no effect, perhaps a little publicity will do no                  harm. For the last month the Ram Bagh road is in very bad shape. It was dug up by the P.W.D. Department for laying a new                  water pipe about a month ago. But since then it has not been repaired. Moreover, there are heaps of roadmetal on both sides of                  the road, which leave very little space in the middle. It is scandalous that we should be felt inconvenient in this way for weeks.                  There have been traffic jams and it is positively dangerous for vehicles to pass that way. Serious accidents may happen. The                  surface in the middle is also badly broken up by the heavy rains. However the Municipal council of the locality is sleeping                  over the matter.                   I hope the public will bring pressure to bear on those responsible so that the road may be put in thorough repair without further                  delay.

People are making a wrong use of them. They keep them going for almost twenty four hours. Early in the                  morning our sleep is disturbed by the religious songs from temples, gurudwaras and mosques. These are used on the occasions                  of marriages, jagarans, public functions, elections and for publicity. Shopkeepers use them to attract customers. They play                  film songs the whole day. Students, teachers and thinkers, philosophers are the worst sufferers. They find it difficult to                  concentrate on their studies and deep thinking with so much noise around them. The sick people and infants also suffer a lot.                  Besides, they impair the hearing power also. Patients cannot take rest or sleep.                   There should be some restriction on the use of loudspeakers. There should be a need of special permission from the authority                  for using them and that too with a time limit, otherwise the persons using them without earlier permission should be heavily               English Grammar \& Composition IX-X                   96","penalised.

Write a letter to the Editor, The Hindu, expressing your views on                  violence against women.

For example, violence against women is still practised almost in all male-                  dominated societies of the world. Hardly a day passes, when one does not read about a young woman taking her life because of                  constant harassment by her husband and in-laws. And how some wild people burn the brides for the sake of dowry. While                  some beat their wives on flimsy grounds. Life is, in fact, a great burden for such women. They also toil from morning to                  evening. Boys should come forward against the inhuman treatment given to such women by their husbands, in-laws or                  collegues. Media can also play a very important role in combating this social evil. A social revolution is a must. It is                  satisfactory that Indian woman today is awakening to her rights. They are IAS, IPS, pilots, successful business persons,                  politicians, etc. But much more is required to be done so that they may get themselves respect.

About the evil of drinking                   Write a letter to the Editor of a newspaper highlighting the evil of drinking.              Ans.   Examination Hall                   XYZ                   3 Feb, 20XX                   Sir,                   Subject : Evil of  drinking (against wine-shop)                   In a country where majority of the people are groaning under the weight of poverty, hunger and disease, to waste money on                  drinking is a sheer nuisance, It is rapidly growing among our youth, especially school and college-going students. For them it                  is a symbol of high society to drink in clubs, parties and even social activities. It is a medium of celebration for them. There is                  no restriction upon them. The parents should come forward to maintain a check on them. People drink to one another's health,                  but they do not realise that they are spoiling their own health. There is hardly any social, political and now even religious                  function where drinks are not served, while the truth is that drinking wrecks a person completely–physically, mentally,                  morally and financially. The drunkards make ugly gestures and use vulgar language. This even sometimes leads to public                  violence. So we highly protest the opening of the wine shop in our locality. The protests of the residents to the civic-authorities                  have yielded no fruit.                   So it is high time that all the enlightened people, social reformers should join hands to make the youth aware of all the evil                  effects of drinking.

Malfunctioning of  public distribution                  system encourages the black marketeers. Neither the grower nor the consumer is happy. Profiteering and black marketing                  have become a curse for a common man. Hence, there is a need for people to come together and form a consumer association.                                                                     97","It is the right of consumers to get things at reasonable prices without adulteration. In fact, the organisation can set up co-                  operative stores where everyday articles can be sold at no profit-no loss basis. This will prevent shopkeepers from raising the                  prices.                   Consumers also must wake up to their rights and not accept the situation in a resigned manner. Otherwise, the greedy                  businessmen will continue to play havoc with the lives of the people.                   I hope you will give a wide publicity to my views so that strong actions can be taken against the hoarders and black                  marketeers.

About ragging in colleges                   Write a letter to the Editor of a newspaper describing the ill-effects of ragging in the colleges.              Ans.

It is                  definitely a well thought ruling on the part of the Supreme Court.                   Originally the concept of ragging was to introduce the new students to their seniors. It was meant to help the freshers                  overcome the nervousness of their first days in college.                   But it gradually turned into bullying of the freshers by seniors. This became a serious fashion when students began to face not                  only mental but also psychological and physical torture. Some students who could not face this type of ragging, left the                  colleges or even committed suicide.                   The intentions were perhaps harmless, but the methods became dangerous. However the parents of the coming generation of                  college goers will have a sigh of relief. For, their children would have, at least, one problem less, to face, in this world already                  affected by cut throat competetition  and unemployment.

The roads of Delhi are already                  over crowded with vehicles and pedestrians, stray cattle and footpath vendors add to this hazard. During peak hours the                  consumers, who gather around these vendors occupying the footpath meant for pedestrians, have forced the pedestrians to                  walk along the road making it difficult for the vehicles to move freely without hitting someone. Some of these vendors are                  now erecting permanent tents to serve as shops.                   Until the Delhi Municipal Corporation does something to remove these vendors from the footpaths, some pedestrians,                  cyclists or motorcyclists may lose their lives. The authorities concerned need pull up.                   Yours truly                   Rahul                   Secretary, Welfare Society                 11.

They drive them at break neck speed to beat the clock. They                  even do not slow the vehicles at turns. As a result, many children are thrown from one side to the other. Some even get bumps.                  These buses are often overcrowded. It is a regular nuisance and a great danger to school going children as well as to the                  persons who cannot cross the road quickly. Besides, some of the streets are very busy and over crowded. Even then, they drive                  their buses recklessly. The drivers knock down the people and escape.                   The police and traffic authorities should take immediate measures. The offenders should be brought to books.

Ans.  3, Chanakya Puri                   Haridwar                   3 June, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Hindu                   Sir,                   Subject : Poor lighting and insanitary conditions                   Through the columns of your esteemed paper, I want to express my concern over the suffering of the common people due to                  poor lighting and insanitary conditions in our locality. The sanitation of this town is in a very bad condition for over three                  months. The drains are uncovered. There is no regular arrangement for cleaning these uncovered drains so they give out bad                  smell. Besides, a lot of rubbish lie here and there. There are big pits full of water due to which mosquitoes remain there all the                  time. The lighting on the main roads and streets is inadequate. So accidents occur frequently. Somewhere in the side-streets,                  there is no lighting due to which there are more chances of theft, chain-snatching and mishaps.                   We have already made many requests to the Municipal Coreporation but they have taken no step till now. I, therefore, request to the                  higher authorities to take notice of this poor condition of the locality otherwise it is quite possible that an epidemic may break out.                   Yours truly                   Mukesh                13.  About inefficient transport system                   You are Aashutosh Mukarjee living at 102, Kailash Hills, New Delhi. Write a letter to the editor of a newspaper complaining                  about inefficient transport system.              Ans.  102, Kailash Hills                   New Delhi                   5 Sept, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Hindustan Times                   Sir,                    Subject : Inefficient transport system                   I would like to draw attention of the authority concerned towards the sufferings of the commuters due to the inefficient                  transport system.                   The commuters have to run after the buses as the drivers do not stop the buses at their proper and indicated bus stops. They stop                  them either much before or much ahead of the bus stops. Sometimes young children, women and elderly persons get injured                  while getting into the bus because the conductor is always in a hurry to blow the whistle. Then to get tickets people gather                  around the conductor's seat and fall on one another, when the driver suddenly takes a turn or applies the brakes. After reaching                                                                    99","the destination the passengers have to jump off a crawling bus which often leads to accidents. Sometimes drivers miss trips                  and this leads to overcrowded bus stops. Sometimes they refuse to take the bus to its destination.                   I am confident that the Delhi Transport Corporation will take prompt action against the erring staff, so that the passengers may                  travel in peace and hope reach their destination, safe and sound at the expected time.                   Yours faithfully                   Aashutosh Mukarjee               14.  About a blood donation camp                   You are Deepak Khandelwal living at 6/1-B, Court Road, Ahmedabad. Write a letter to the Editor of a newspaper describing                  him the experience of a blood donation camp organised in your school.              Ans.   6/1-B Court Road                   Ahmedabad                   7 April, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Times of India                   Sir,                   Subject : Blood donation camp in our school                   Through your esteemed column, I would like to bring my unique experience of donating blood to the public notice, so that                  others may get inspiration from it. Our institution is a member of Red Cross Society. This society does a lot for the welfare of                  common people. This time our school organised a blood donation camp to help the poor and the sufferer. A team of trained                  doctors was with us to collect the blood. Many teachers along with the principal himself came forward to donate their blood                  willingly. Many senior students also took part in it. First of all, the principal and then all others donated one bottle of blood one                  by one. Thus we were able to donate one hundred and forty one bottles of blood under the supervision of the doctors. These all                  bottles were handed over to Red Cross Society.                   This experience was certainly a motivating one. All the doners were happy. They all felt a sense of satisfaction to think that                  their blood will be given to someone needy and will save the life of a sufferer.                   Yours truly                   Deepak Khandelwal                15.  About the growth of slums in the cities                   You are Neelam / Neelima of 1/5-B, Kailash Hills, New Delhi. Write a letter to the Editor of   'The Hindustan Times'                  expressing your concern about the growth of slums in the cities.              Ans.  1/5-B, Kailash Hills                   New Delhi                   6 June, 20XX                   The Editor                   The Hindustan Times                   Sir,                   Subject : Growth of slums in the cities                   Through your esteemed column I want to express my concern about the growth of slums in the city. Foremost among the                  reasons is the huge increase in population resulting in unemployment in the villages, leading to the mass migration of rural                  people to cities in search of work. Here they are bound to construct temporary jhuggis to protect themselves from the forces of                  nature. In course of time, they become slums as there are no civic amenities like water, toilets, sanitation, drainage and                  electricity, etc.                   To check the growth of slums in the cities our government should improve the economic condition in the rural areas. An effort                  should be made to develop satellite towns with all the basic infrastructure like roads, transport and hospitals. The slum                  dwellers should be provided with a dwelling unit at affordable price.                   This problem should not be neglected any longer. It has to be tackled properly and sincerely to achieve results.                   Yours faithfully                   Neelam                 16.  About private tuition                   You are Ranjana Singhal living at 801/5-C, Sudarshan Park, New Delhi. Write a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing                  your concern about private tuition which has become a part and parcel of present education system.              Ans.   801/5-C, Sudarshan Park                   New Delhi                   23 July, 20XX                   The Editor                                                                   100","Indian Express                   Sir,                   Subject : Private tuition                   Through your esteemed column, I would like to express my concern over private tuition, which has proliferated into our                  educational system in such a manner, that it has become impossible to get rid of it. After school hours, students take private                  tuition so as to improve their performance. It has become a regular practice of the students. Nowadays it is so popular among                  students that not only the weak students but the students having good percentage also take tuitions. The problem can be solved                  out only if the teachers pay more attention to the weak students. The prescribed text books should be perfect, written in a                  simple and interesting manner, easy to grasp. The emphasis should not be onto cramming them all and to pass out but to                  understand properly. To increase knowledge should be the sole purpose of the teachers while teaching through text books. The                  parents should also pay more attention to the education of the children. They should not pressurise them unnecessarily and                  must allow them to choose subjects of their own choice. There is a hope that the influence of private tuition can be reduced to                  minimum by applying the above in the student's life.                   Yours faithfully                   Ranjana Singhal                                                     EXERCISE FOR PRACTICE               1.

While our team has                  shown positive results in inter-zonal tournaments, we are unable to practice more due to this difficulty. This is a great                  hindrance in the progress of our hockey team. The inter-zonal school tournaments of this season are to commence from 1 July,                  20XX.

In the recess period the students are forced to purchase the edible items from the hawkers                  standing outside the school. They have the material of very inferior quality and sell their items at a very high rate. By eating                  those stale and unhygienic food stuff the students fall sick at several times.                   I, being the head girl of the school, request you to make arrangement for a good canteen facility so that the students may get                  clean, hygienic refreshment from the canteen at reasonable price.                   I hope you will understand our problem and will do the needful at your earliest.

I want to bring to your kind notice the problem faced by my younger sister, Rajni Kashyap who studies at your school in class                  IX-C. She could not get a copy of the book containing question-bank in English from the library because it was not available.                  As you know that CBSE has changed the style of questions in English and it has provided the sample book to all the schools                  only. The librarian Mrs. Kaushik told us that the copies of the particular book are insufficient to meet the demands of all the                  students. So it is a great hindrance for the students in preparing exactly according to the latest pattern of the questions.                   I, therefore, request you to order for more number of the book to fulfil the need of the students so that they could prepare well                  and upto the mark for the ensuing examination.

WRITING AN ARTICLE, SPEECH OR DEBATE                 An article or  a speech that is to be written in near about 120 words may have one paragraph or more. It can be a number of             sentences grouped together and relating to one topic or a group of related sentences that develop a single point. The division of an             article into paragraphs must be made according to the changes of ideas introduced. A paragraph may consist of a single sentence, or             of many sentences. There is, therefore, no rule as to the length of a paragraph.                  Points to remember for effective writing                  v  The first and foremost rule to be observed in constructing an article or speech is that of unity. Just as each sentence deals with                    one thought, each paragraph must deal with one idea and every sentence must be closely connected with the main topic of                    the article.                 v  Try to give a short heading or title to the article or debate, which will express in a word or in a brief phrase the                    subject of the article to be discussed in.                 v  The theme or the subject of the article is very often expressed in the first sentence of the article. This sentence is                    called the topical sentence because it states the topic or the key sentence that unlocks the subject to be dealt                    with in the article.                 v  Then, there should be a logical sequence of the thought or development of the subject. Events must be related in                    the order of their occurence and all ideas should be connected with the leading idea arranged according to their                    importance.                 v  The last sentence is equally important. It should bring the whole paragraph on the topic to a conclusion. It should                    satisfy the interest of the reader aroused by the topical sentence. It should be a full and rounded one to conclude                    the topic.                 v  The sentences should be constructed grammatically correct and only appropriate words should be used. There                    is no need of using high sounding words having wrong meaning in the context.                 v  Then,  the  spellings  should  be  correct,  punctuation  marks  and  capitalization  at  the  proper  place  must  be                    indicated. Ideas should not be irrelevant to the main point. Proper form of the verbs should be used according to                    the tenses.                 v  In short, the article having one or more paragraphs should begin with the topical sentence which should clearly                    state the subject. The following sentences must explain the statement by expanding it and the concluding                    sentence must sum the paragraph up by a re-statement of the topical sentence in other words. The principles of                    unity and order must be kept in mind. The language should be simple, the style direct and the sentences short                    and, as a paragraph is limited, all diffuseness must be avoided.                  The Student is provided with verbal or visual stimulus.                  (a)   Verbal Stimulus– The verbal stimulus include extract from an article in a magazine/ newspaper report, notice, message,             advertisement, table, diary extract, etc. Sometimes, the verbal stimulus is provided in the rubric itself.                  (b)   Visual Stimulus– The visual stimulus include a diagram, picture, map, cartoon, graph or flow chart, etc.                  These stimulus are provided for helping the students in writing according to the point/idea mentioned in the paper. The students             should take notice of this information carefully and utilize it to extend their point of views thoroughly in a precise manner. No             information should be left out while constructing article or a paragraph or a speech. While writing a speech you may add one more             line in the beginning, according to the gathering to whom it is to be addressed. For example – Respected Principal and dear friends,             ladies and gentlemen, My dear friends, etc.                                                            Solved Examples                                                       (Based on Verbal Stimulus)               1.  A newspaper in Chandigarh wants to publish an article about the increasing awareness of health and diet. The table below                 shows some of the changes in Chandigarh between 1990 and 2010. Using this information, together with your own ideas, write                 the article in about 120 words.                             Health in Chandigarh                         1990                 2010                             Number of yoga and health clubs              2                    10                             People using non-refined oil                 45%                  10%                              Number of magazines on health care           3                    10                             T.V. Programmes on health                    1%                   6%                             Death rate                                   15.0%                11.7%                                                                    108","Ans. A Healthier Generation                  It seems that the people of Chandigarh have begun to realise that health is wealth. Increasing awareness of health and diet is             proved by the facts that cover two decades from 1990 to 2010. In 1990 there were only 2 yoga and health clubs here but now they are             ten. The number of magazines on health and care published from the city, has increased more than three times and T.V. programmes             on health have started coming on all the six days of a week except Sundays while in 1990 it could be seen only once a week. The             people have brought about a change in their food habit too. In order to avoid the modern problem of increasing cholesterol, people             have decreased the consumption of non-refined oil upto 50%. As a result the standard of health of average man has increased and             death rate has fallen down from 15% to 11.7% . People should take more care of their health because it is a key to happiness and only             a healthy man can enjoy life with its infinite pleasures.                2.  A table showing women's education and status in the year 2000 and 2010 respectively has been given below. Write an article in                 about 120 words with the help of the given data together with your own ideas.                            Women's Education \& Status                    2000                2010                            Illiterate women                              60000               8000                            Receiving education in schools                30%                 48%                            Receiving higher education                    8%                  18%                            Employed women                                800                 20000                            Women in self- employment                     –                   30              Ans. Women's Education and Status                  In the field of literacy the achievements of Aazad Nagar are praise worthy. In the year 2000 the number of illiterate women was             60,000 but this number has reduced to 8,000 in 2010. Although much is to be achieved yet. Now people have started taking it seriously             to educate their daughters. The 30% women went to school for receiving education in the year 2000, this percentage has also             increased to 48. It is really commendable that women have started taking higher education too. This percentage was very low in 2000,             just only 8%, now it has reached to 18% in the year 2010. This became possible only due to the change in outlook of the people. Not             only this, women are now aware and conscious regarding their career. They want to be self-dependent and employed. There is much             increase in the number of self-dependent women. Nearly 20,000 women are doing jobs presently while in the year 2000 this number             was only 800. Today women are not feeling hesitation in taking risks. They are running their own business too. While in the past they             had no such courage. Today we can see employed woman in every sphere of life. Really they deserve our salute and appreciation.                 3.  The extract from a diary of a reporter is given below. He went on to mountains with a group of his college friends. The                 mountains were covered with snow. He noted down some points for his memory. With the help of the following points of his                 diary, write an article/ paragraph on the incident. Give a suitable title to it.

'Camp in the Snow'                                                                  18 March 20XX                  We were standing at a height of 2184 metres. It was darkness all around. We were to spend the night there. Everyone was busy             trying to put up the tent. We used double layered plastic sheets for the tent and for the ground. The air between the layers would help             to keep us warm. We put in the pegs and began to put up the tent. As we tied it from one side, the wind flew the tent from the other side.             After quite a lot of pulling and tugging, we managed to get the tent up. Then we dug a drain around the tent.                  We were feeling very hungry. We collected some firewood and stones to make a chulha and cooked some food. After the meal             we collected all the waste in a bag to clean the camp site. Soon we got into our sleeping bags. I was not sure if I would be able to sleep             in it. But the bags were filled with soft feathers, which helped in keeping us warm. We were all very tired. So very soon we fell asleep.                4.  Read the following extract of a diary of a reporter and write an article / paragraph in about 120 words.                  Agra                                                                                 18 th July 20XX                  Students indulged in stone throwing, Arson – torched a Redline bus – killing of a college student in Shastri Nagar by Redline                  bus – driver caught and beaten – other drivers assembled – a pitched battle ensued                  Police arrived – resorted to lathi- charge and tear gas – bazaar closed – strike for next day called – the mob agitated                  Transport Minister arrived – pacified the mob – judicial inquiry ordered                                                                   109","Ans. 'Redline Bus killed a College Student'                                                                                                    Agra 19 July, 20XX                  The incident occurred at 10.30 am on 18 July, 20XX when a redline bus killed a college student in Shastri Nagar resulting in a             great confusion and disorder. The crowd gathered. The agitated students started throwing stones on the buses. They even willingly             burnt a redline bus to ashes. The driver of the bus was caught and beaten a lot by the angry mob. Other redline drivers also assembled             at the spot. The situation became worse and beyond control. It was like a pitched battle that followed afterwards.                  Meanwhile the police arrived to make the situation under control. They turned up to lathi-charge and tear gas. The situation was             so terrific that all the nearby markets were closed. The students called for a strike for the next day.                  The Transport minister had also arrived, somehow he managed to pacify the mob and ordered for the judicial inquiry of the             matter.                5.  You are Dushyant. You noticed that students of senior classes pass their time in visiting video parlorus, loitering on playing                 grounds, sitting in canteens during school hours.                  Write an article on the problem of truancy and bunking classes with the help of the notes given below.                   Truancy and bunking classes – rampant in senior students – fashion among senior school classes.                   Causes – homework not done– fear of punishment – unprepared for class test / examination – fear of failure – uninteresting                  subject matter – dislike for teacher – preparation for extra curricular activities – unplanned outings.                   Suggestions – counselling – sympathetic understanding of children's problems – rewards and punishment             Ans. Truancy and Bunking Classes                  Nowadays it is a matter of serious concern that a growing tendency of bunking classes and truancy is developing fast among             students of senior classes. The senior students have become exuberant. This is a part of fashion to spend their time in visiting video             parlours, roaming aimlessly on playing grounds, sitting in canteens instead of joining classes.                  The causes responsible for this can be many. The students are afraid of being punished on account of their non-completion of             home work. They are never ready for class tests or examination so, they have a fear of failure. Sometimes they are forced to take             subjects in which they are least interested. Similarly they may have a disliking for a certain teacher.                  Some students take more interest in extra curricular activities instead of their studies. They prefer to spend their time in             preparing for such activities to attend the classes. Their outings are unplanned and non-systematic.                  A few suggestions can be advised to curb this menace. A counselling team including parents, psychologists and teachers can be             called upon to have an interaction with students with a purpose to understand the root of their problem sympathetically. Besides,             there can be a feed back in the form of rewards and punishment as per requirement. The students, found guilty of truancy and bunking             classes should be punished.                6.  Sunita Williams took the following notes in a hurry, describing her experience of  living in space. Develop it into an article or a                 well-knit paragraph for her about her experience with the help of the given notes.                   – could not sit – kept floating – spaceship – water – not at one place – floats around – blobs – wet paper – floating food packets                  – comb – hair kept standing – strap – ourselves – stuck to the wall – difficult.             Ans. Living in Space                  We could not sit at one place. We kept floating in the spaceship from one end to another, water too doesn't stay at one place. It             floats around as blobs. To wash our face or hands we had to catch these blobs and wet paper with them. We ate very differently there.             The real fun was when all of us would float into the dining area of the spaceship and catch the floating food packets. In space there             was no need to use a comb. My hair kept standing all the time. Not being able to walk, we had to get used to floating around. We had to             learn to do simple things differently. To stay at one place, we had to strap ourselves there. Papers also had to be stuck to the wall of the             spaceship. It was a lot of fun living in space but it was also difficult.                 7.  Nikhil  Mathur is a resident of prempuri. He reads a news given below and gets irritated on the rising prices and wants to make                 an appeal to the government to reconsider its decision. Using the news extract given below, together with your own ideas, write                 an article for him.                   New Delhi                                                                                  December 17, 20XX                  The Union cabinet decided to increase the prices of wheat, rice, cooking gas and petrol by 10 to 20 per cent. The LPG                  cylinder shall cost ` 20 more, petrol by 20% while wheat and rice shall cost ` 65 and 23 more respectively. The new prices of                  cooking gas and petrol come into force from tomorrow.              Ans. Rising Prices                  It was a shocking news for the mass to read that the union cabinet has decided to increase the prices of common commodities             like wheat, rice, cooking gas and petrol by 10 to 20 per cent. The common people are already finding it difficult to make their both             ends meet. The middle class people have to pay income tax. It will be burdensome for them too. The LPG cylinder shall now be given                                                                  110","at the cost of ` 350 which is ` 20 more than the previous price. The rate of petrol is now ` 70 per litre, it is hiked by 20 per cent. The             cost of wheat has been increased ` 65 more, and for purchasing rice you will have to payt ` 23 more. The latest price list is to be             applied from tomorrow.                  All the people have been burdened more while they had been expecting some relief this year. It is like strangulating the people.             The opposition parties have threatened to launch an agitation against this price rise. The government must reconsider its decision as             it is a matter related to the common people.                8.  You are Pawan studying at G.C. Public School, Bhiwani. You are deeply upset to read the following report in a newspaper.                   Every year thousands of people die because of hunger and homelessness, unidentified on the streets of our cities. Last year                  the number reached 3,040 in the capital (according to Delhi Police official records). It is imperative to create facilities during                  the extreme weather conditions to save many more lives from completely avoidable deaths, and to provide them at least one                  hot meal.                  You think why these homeless people couldn't be provided shelter in the buildings of schools / colleges and places of worship             during chilly nights. You decide to write an article for your school magazine to motivate the students, teachers and principal to act as             a responsible social institution and provide shelter to the homeless people. Write an article in minimum 120 words.             Ans. Shelter to Homeless People                  India is a developing country even then it is painful to learn that thousands of people die due to hunger and homelessness every             year. Although it is the prime duty of the government to provide means of education to each and every one, to make them deserving             candidate for an employment and to ensure their livelihood, yet the role of society is equally important to avoid such misfortune.             Those who are unluckily homeless should be provided with roof, food and cloths. For this purpose, the premises of schools, colleges             and places of worship can be utilized in a systematic manner to provide shelter during the extreme weather conditions. Many more             lives can be saved if these hungry people be served at least one hot meal. There are such organisations as are willing to help these             needy people. They can be asked to manage one meal. Moreover these people can be given some work as per their capacity to earn             their livelihood. If there is a will, there is a way. The need is only to come forward with a determination to avoid such deaths.                9.  Nowadays people are facing many problems caused by pollution. Environmental pollution is a big threat to all of us. You are                 Raghav Verma studying in class X. Write an article in minimum 120 words telling the reasons responsible for it and giving                 suggestions to overcome this problem.             Ans. Environmental Pollution                  Nowadays human existence is in danger because of the increasing environmental pollution. The main reason of poisoning the             atmosphere is over population. The increasing demand of food and houses is leading man to cut the forests. This increases the ratio of             carbon dioxide in the environment. The result is that the sun is heating the earth's atmosphere abnormally. It is called global warming,             an indication of disaster for the living beings. Besides, various chemical factories emit poisonous smoke and burning of fossil fuel in             various vehicles also emits poisonous substances. That's why, metropolitan cities have become death traps. People will have to wear             masks.                  So, it is the call of the hour that this increasing pollution of the biosphere should be checked. It can be done by conservation of             forests, reducing the use of petrol in vehicles, etc. At any cost we have to save our earth from destruction for the sake of our own             survival.                10.  As we all know that the main reason of global warming is deforestation, danger is increasing day by day. So, warning against                 deforestation, write a speech in favour of plantation in minimum 120 words.             Ans. Deforestation                  Dear members of the faculty                  As we all are aware of the fact that deforestation causes global warming. The underlying causes of deforestation are rooted in             current economic development programmes. 50000 species of plants and animals become extinct every year due to deforestation.             Deforestation is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. It is the permanent             destruction of indigenous forests and woodlands. It is a major cause of climate change because it releases huge amount of carbon             dioxide into the atmosphere. The datas tell that we destroy 130000 sq. Km. of world's forest every year by cutting trees.                  So we should plant millions of trees each year to help the planet cool and to prevent global warming and to keep the             environment pollution free. So I appeal to all citizens, civil agencies, schools and other greening bodies to plant more saplings and             nurture them and to be a partner in the endeavour for a greener and cleaner environment.                                                            MISCELLANEOUS              11.  Pure water is a boon. Without it life is not possible. But now water crisis is at hand. Telling the importance of water, write a                 speech on 'water crisis' in some of the cities of India with the help of your imagination.             Ans. 'Water Crisis'                                                                   111","Respected Sirs and dear friends                  Water crisis is a general term used to describe a situation where the available water within a region is less than the region's             demand. Datas tell that one out of six people in the world lacks safe drinking water. While the world's population tripled in the 20th             century, the use of renewable water resources has grown six fold. Unlike war and terrorism the global water crisis does not make             media headlines, despite the fact that it claims more lives through diseases than any war.                  The reason is simple–people waste a lot of water which could be saved otherwise. Water is precious and the time has come that             we must save every drop of it. Try bucket baths instead of a shower and you can save 500 ltrs. of water per person every month. Water             your plants with the waste water of the kitchen. Let the tap not run while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Get the leaky tap             repaired at once. If this gets done the water crisis will not dare at all to approach us.               12.  You recently noticed that some of your college friends have started taking drugs which are very harmful for their health. You                 want to write an article warning them about the ill effect of drugs upon health. You can take help of the following notes while                 writing.                   – what are drugs – drug addiction – out of curiosity – for pleasure – to remove aloofness – symptoms – depression – loss of                  interest in games – routine disturbs – lack of appetite – puffy eyes – lack of clarity in vision – irritative temperament –                  harmful effects.             Ans. Drug-Addiction                  Many street drugs like heroin, cocaine, crack, methane, marijuana are very common to youngsters. First of all they take drugs             out of curiosity and for pleasure. Drugs give them pleasure to stay aloof and aside. But soon they are addicted to drugs which in itself             is a disease. There are many harmful effects of drugs on body. The student goes into deep depression. He does not take interest in             games and other routine activities. He feels less energetic. His eyes are puffed, vision becomes unclear. His temperament becomes             non-predictable.                  There are many harmful effects of drug addiction on body ranging from mild itching to comas and death besides many             psychological harmful effects, extremely difficult to endure. Addictive drugs make their way to the bloodstream and go straight to             the brain. They mimic the brain's natural chemicals instead of teaching us to repeat survival behaviour like eating, drinking, bathing             etc. They teach us to take more drugs. If their use continues, the harmful effects of drugs gradually change the user's brain and lead to             drug addiction.                  According to the recent government survey in 2008, 8.3% of the students in senior high schools were interested in drugs.             Parents can control their children's exposure to drugs by monitoring their activities, behaviour and friendship. Only a self disciplined             mind can get rid of it under medical supervision. So strike drugs before they strangle you.               13.  You are Anshul Sharma studying in a hostel. You came across the following news extract which is about smart security.                 Students of a college in Delhi will now enter the college and hostel premises using a digital smart card. Write an article in favour                 of CCTV cameras and digital smart cards for your college magazine to encourage its use in your hostel too.                   The smart cards will capture complete information about the student (name, course, roll  number, room number, etc.) which                  will get stored in a computer housed with the hostel's warden.                   Introduction of CCTV cameras with night vision and audio facility installed in corridors, none inside any hostel room.             Ans. Digital Smart Cards and CCTV Cameras in School Premises.                  A college of Delhi University is ready to set a benchmark for all other DU colleges as far as security of its students is concerned.             The college has come up with an idea of providing digital smart cards to its students, which will allow them entry into the college gate             for ensuring their safety. With the cards in place, students need not verify their identity to security guards each time they enter. This             step will bring down students' interactions with security guards to a negligible amount. Apart from the college, the hostel premises             too, will have the facility of entry through digital cards. As soon as a student uses the card in the hostel gate, complete information             about the student like his name, course, roll no. and room no., etc will get stored in a computer housed with the hostel warden. This             way, the warden would be able to keep a track of students. The warden will monitor student's information on the computer.                  In another effort to ensure safety of students, the college has upgraded its CCTV surveillance in the hostels with night vision             camera and audio facility at the main gate, library, hostel, and in the corridors to prevent ragging but not in any of the rooms so that             strict action can be taken against the culprit.               14.  Global warming is one of the most burning topics today. You are also conscious of the fact. You want to make a speech upon the                 topic in your college assembly. Write a speech in about 120 words with the help of the following notes.                   – continuous rise – temperature of Earth – carbon – fossil fuel – deforestation – methane – malaria – dengue – other diseases -                  2003 heat wave in Europe – 35000 deaths – automobiles – plants – a store house of carbon – modern farming – less fossil                  fuels – otherwise less hospitable climate in future– U.S. \& China – biggest emitters – carbon dioxide – little hope – secure                  future.             Ans. 'Global Warming'                  Respected Principal and dear friends              English Grammar \& Composition IX-X                  112","It is not a very new topic for a speech. Most of you already know something about the problem of global warming.                  Global warming is the continuous rise in the average temperature of earth's atmosphere and oceans. It leads to changes in             rainfall patterns, a rise in sea level and wide range of impacts on plants, wild life and human beings. Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel,             deforestation, methane from cattle and rice paddies, nitrogen oxide from farming and several other gases from other sources are the             chief causes of it. The warmest year was 2005. Within the last decade, there were outbreaks of both malaria and dengue fever in the             U.S. Other tropical diseases will undoubtedly spread as the temperature rises. Europe's 2003 heat wave caused an estimated 35000             deaths. It also causes crop failures.                  Automobiles are one of the major sources of global carbon emissions. Unfortunately we are currently destroying some of the             best known mechanisms for storing that carbon and that is tree. Deforestation increases the severity of global warming as well. All             living plants store carbon but when those plants die and decay, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. The modern             farming is also contributing more to global warming by releasing methane and nitrogen oxide. Carbon dioxide is released every time             we use fossil fuels, currently our main energy source. This means that we must burn less fossil fuel if we want the earth's climate to             remain stable. If things going unlike this, our children and grand children will inherit a world with a far less hospitable climate. The             U.S. and China are the two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide world wide. Unless we stop these emissions, there is little hope of a             secure future for humans.                                                            Solved Examples                                                       (Based on Visual Stimulus)              15.  Speech based on Visual Stimulus                  Recently junk food or fast food has been banned in school canteens. A survey was done among the students belonging to the age             group of 10-18 years in 20 leading schools of Delhi and NCR region. The following graph is the conclusion. Write a speech             conveying your ideas about the implementation of the order in your school.

In view of the increasing number of lifestyle–illnesses in children, the central government is set to ban junk foods in school             canteens and colleges across the country. With the imposition of this ban fast food items like pizzas, burgers, samosas, pakoras and             cold drinks will be out of reach for school and college students. Highlighting the need for implementing laid down standards for food             served in school canteens, a servey was conducted recently to understand children's preferences towards healthy and unhealthy food             choices. Majority of the students were willing to go for healthier foods. According to the survey nearly a quarter of the students             consume food from school canteens at least twice a week. At the same time 55% of this category were interested in taking fruit juices,             20% wanted to take whole wheat noodles or sandwiches and the rest 25% students preferred flavored milk.                  Not only the children and their parents but three fourths of the canteen operators were also found to be open to the idea of             providing healthier foods in the survey.                  So what is clearly needed at the moment is guidance from concerned authorties to bring on the much needed shift. Imposing a             ban will really help as it is in schools that children spend a great deal of their time.

How to Prepare a Sandwich                  To prepare a delicious salty sandwich is not a child's play. It needs a genuine concentration. Here is the method of preparing it.             First of all, you have to boil the required amount of potatoes. For this put potatoes in the pressure cooker with sufficient amount of             water. It takes four or five whistles to get the potatoes boiled. Then you have to peel potatoes and cut into very small pieces. To make             the masala delicious, add salt, red chilli power, coriander powder, pieces of green chilli, green coriander, etc. Then put some oil in the             frypan with little jeera and fry the potatoes with masalas. Then take a sandwich maker and put some oil on both sides of it. Put one             piece of bread on each side adding fried potatoes in the middle. Tighten the sandwich maker and put on the burner till each side gets             brown. Your sandwich is ready.m                2.  You are Shreya Goswami. Your teacher has given a poster showing those persons who do not know the value of cleanliness.                 Write a speech on 'Keeping Our Surroundings Clean' for your college assembly. You can add your own views too.                                                                                                            114","Ans.   Respected Principal and teachers and my dear friends–                   As you all know that recently there was a outbreak of plague due to the uncleanliness and unhygienic conditions.  The reason is             very clear that the whole of the city has become a big dustbin and garbage centre emitting foul smell. Pigs, dogs and other insects can             be seen swirling and hovering over these heaps. It is the high time that we should have a pledge to ourselves to keep the city neat and             clean. We should start from our own houses. The housedhold garbage should be collected in the covered dustbins. These dustbins are             carried away by municipal bins and the garbage is generally buried. Then proper insecticides should be sprayed to kill the germs             which cause many diseases like cholera, typhoid, diarrhoea, etc. There must be no garbage mound near our house. Moreover if our             surroundings have stagnant water, there is a risk of malaria. So, there should be no standing water inside or outside the house. If we             keep domestic animals, their stables or sheds should be cleaned with phenyl. Spitting in the open is also a very bad habit. It attracts             flies. When these flies sit on uncovered food the germs can enter our body and this may cause diseases. So, we must keep our houses             and surroundings clean to stay healthy and fit.                3.  Vaishali sees the following poster and decides to write a speech on the several uses of the fuel. But at the same time she thinks it                 necessary to save it from being wasted. Write a speech for her with the help of the information provided in the poster.                                                  For dry cleaning                                                                                  As petrol, diesel or                                                         For lighting            aeroplane fuel                                                            Where am I used?                                       As kerosene and LPG                                                                                     For making                                                                                  plastic and paints                                                            To run machines                                                      \"Save Fuel, Make it a Habit\"                 Ans. It is not easy to find out where oil is, deep down below the Earth. Scientists use special techniques and machines to find this out.             Then through pipes and machines petroleum is pumped up. This oil is smelly, thick, dark coloured liquid. It is sent to refinery then we             get  kerosene, diesel, petrol, engine oil and fuel for aircrafts. LPG, wax, coaltar and grease are also obtained from this. So, there are             several uses of it. It is also used in making several other things like plastics and paints. It is used for dry cleaning, for lighting and to run             machines. But to save it is equally important. It is the most valuable thing nature has given to us. So, it is our duty to save it as much as             possible. Not a single drop is allowed to be wasted because these are not going to last for ever. You should switch off the engine when             you stop your vehicle. For it takes lakhs of years for it to be formed under the Earth. So, make it your habit to save fuel, it is precious,                4.

Respected teachers and my dear friends.                  Today I am here to present my views on one of the social evils, i.e. 'Dowry System'. In ancient times it was to help the newly             married couple to set up their home, but in the year 2000 dowry has taken a fearful form. The datas tell that 170 cases of suicide were             reported to the police. There were 200 cases of burning while 220 agreed to remarry. Least marriages were successful. So this dowry             is a great curse and challenge to Indian society. Daily the newspapers bring news of murder of poor innocent girls by their in-laws             because they could not get dowry as they desired. So dowry is a great curse and challenge  to Indian society.                  But recently due to the ban imposed by government and severe penalty upon those who encouraged it, the number of suicide             cases has decreased to 100 in the year 2010 and 50 cases of burning have been reported to the police and 200 agreed to remarry out of             total 300, yet there is long way to go. Government's efforts are praise-worthy but it is we, the youth, who have to come forward to             eradicate this social evil from the society completely.                5.

Ans. Respected Principal and teachers and dear friends.                  As you all know that India is the largest populated country in the world after China. Her population now is nearly 130 crore.             There has been an increase of over 18 crore during the last ten years. Thus the population of India has crossed one billion mark. With             the final figures of census 2001 being available, the population of India as on March 1,2001 stands nearly one billion two crore. Out             of which the men number was 53 crore and the number of female citizens was 49 crore approximately. So there is a clear increase of             nearly 20%. The census has thrown some very encouraging facts. The most important thing is that during the last decade the male-             female ratio has improved. According to the last census there were nearly 910 women against 1000 men. In the current census it has             risen to 920. Utter Pradesh has the largest share of population of the country. The share of Uttar Pradesh is 16%. The population of             Uttar Pradesh is 16 crore of which men are 9 crore and women are 8 crore.                  Ignorance is the root cause of all evils. Unless education is provided to each and every one, we cannot sit comfortably. People             should be made well aware about the dangers of large families so that all round welfare of the country may be brought about.                                                            MISCELLANEOUS               6.  You found the following information in a general knowledge book. You want to write an article on importance of literacy                 mentioning the following datas. Also suggest some measures to remove it from rural areas. You are Rohit Ahuza studying in                 class X.

Most of the people living in the             villages and slums are illiterate. Although the present literacy rate has reached the mark of 64.8 per cent of which the percentage of             male literacy is 75.3 while that of female literacy, it is 53.7. It means that of the four males, three are literate while every second             woman is literate. Yet we have miles to go to be able to touch the mark 100.                  In matters of literacy Kerala has done much, with the literacy percentage being 90.9. Mizoram stands 2nd with 88.8 % literacy             and Lakshdweep occupying the third place with 86.7%, Bihar's literacy percentage is only 47 per cent, the lowest in the country.                  Students can organise adult education classes in groups. They can pay individual attention to the illiterates by investing their             spare time to educate them. We all must participate in a continuous campaign again illiteracy. Women also must come forward to             educate their daughters, sisters because if one woman is educated, she is able to make hundred others literate.                7.

Regular exercise will add                            5 years to your life span.                 Ans. Smoking is injurious to health. It decreases life span by an average of five years. The best thing is to do, not to start it at all.             Then no question of leaving it would arise. Many serious diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity are born partly             because of smoking regularly, contrary to it the datas tell that regular exercise will add five years to your life span. The choice is             totally yours. Cigarette smoking is one of the main causes of coronary heart disease world wide. By 2030 it will be the main cause of             death globally and will be responsible for 9.6 million deaths or 14% of the total every year. The risk of developing coronary heart             disease is 25% higher for women smokers compared with men, according to a study. India ranks third among the top 20 female             smoking population across the world. The tobacco industry views women as its growth market. Although in most societies smoking             rates are higher for men than for women but more men than women are giving up, the number of female smokers is rising. It is a             worrisome fact and so the tobacco industry continues to see a rise in profits globally.                 8.  Satish, a student of X class sees the following poster in a magazine and decides to write an article  on 'Water Pollution'. Write an                 article for him suggesting some measures to prevent it.                                                     Prevent Water Pollution                                     Ans. Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies e.g. lakes, rivers and oceans. More than 4500 people die everyday             from lack of clean water. Water pollution may not damage our health immediately but can be harmful after long term exposure. Water             from rain, storm, drains and ditches flows directly to streams and bays with little or no treatment. Heavy metals from industrial             processes can accumulate in nearby lakes and rivers. Industrial waste often contains many toxic compounds that damage the health             of equatic animals and those who eat them. They can cause immune suppression, reproductive failure or acute poisoning. Microbial             water pollution can cause diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever. The treatment involves the reduction of organic with the use of             biological filters. Almost all solid particles are removed from the water and chemical additives are supplied to get rid of any left-over             impurities. Then ozone can be used to kill bacteria. It converts back into oxygen quickly. Take great care not to overuse pesticides and                                                                    117","fertilisers. Don't throw litter into rivers. Don't throw paints, oil in your sink or toilet. Conserve water by turning off the tap to reduce             the amount of contaminated water.               9.

'Change in fuel use over Past Twenty Years'                  People use different kinds of fuel for cooking their food. In the year 1986, people spent many hours collecting wood for the             'chulha'. There were seventy four people out of hundred who used chulha. Today nearly two third people in our country use uple,             wood and dry twigs. These are used not only for cooking food but also for keeping warm, for heating water and for lighting. There is a             two times rise in the use of LPG and kerosene. In 1986, LPG and kerosene were used in twenty houses and in 2006, this number             increased to just double, i.e., forty. This means that in twenty years their use increased by 100%. Then the use of coal for domestic use             was limited to only 4 houses out of 100 while in the year 1986 this number used to be ten. And now people have started using             electricity. This number is twenty out of 100 houses. In 1986 only 5 people out of 100 used it for their homely needs. So it is clear             from the facts that in 1986, most people used uple and wood and the least people, i.e., only 5 out of 100 used electricity while in 2006             coal was least used in comparison to all other types of fuels.

DIALOGUE COMPLETION                   This question is given in the paper to check student's skill of writing in the given context. The student has to grasp the meaning             of the preceding lines as well as of the following lines to make the reference clear in his mind. Then he has to complete the dialogue             with the help of his imagination according to the given context.                  The sentence should be logically correct, relevant to the subject matter, coherent, concise, well-knit, grammatically correct and             written in a refined manner.                  There may be two types of questions regarding dialogue completion. First there can be answers already given but having words             in a jumbled order. You have to only rearrange the order of the given words to make it a meaningful sentence for each fill up.             Secondly there may be no clue or hint. The whole sentence you have to write yourself as per need of the whole dialogue. You have to             express your idea in clear and suitable words. It requires higher writing skills. Your answer may be a question, an answer or a remark             according to the sense of the conversation. The sense of the dialogue should not have a break, rather it should be in going on situation             continuously as an organic whole.

It needs a lot of calibre to produce a good story. A good story has a beginning, a middle and an             end with a moral, if any.                  Your story should have such a wonderful beginning as to awaken the interest of the reader. It should have the capacity to             fascinate its readers. For writing very short stories the very first line may be indicative of main characters, the narrative of the place or             the incident, for setting out the scene of the background.                  Then comes the middle part. It is the story itself. There should be a very smooth connection between the begining and the             middle part. The whole action is to be developed logically, coherently, precisely and naturally strictly in the order in which they             happened and arousing the curiosity of the reader at the same time, who is supposed to be spelled bound with the magic of the             incidents occurred and is much interested to complete the story without any break in an effort to challenge his imagination.                  According to Aristotle, the great critic, \"a story is impossible without plot\". It is the whole structure of the incidents, the soul of             story. So the plot should be logically well knit.                  The characters must have some individual traits developed to the full length. The story writer must be very clear about their             characteristics. He should treat each distinguished character with separate vision. Of course, they are the product of the writer's             imagination but they should appear lively, active and appealing to the readers.                  Thus the plot, description of the background and characters all are very important for a good story but ending is no less             important. It tells the conclusions and describes what happened at last. It may give some moral too. Generally the good is rewarded             and the guilty is punished at the end, so that the reader may feel satisfied and convinced at his heart without any confusion. He feels             enjoyed and relaxed and if it is so, the aim of writing a good story is achieved.                  Some points to be remembered :                    First of all, it is the most important thing that you must have a clear idea of the plot, how it is to be started, how it is to be                     developed and how it is to be ended. For this you may note down the main points before starting to write.                    Your beginning should be according to the theme you want to express. It should have the capacity to draw the attention of                     the readers.                     The plot should be well-knit. For this you have to develop points one by one in a logical and natural order. All the incidents should                     be relevant to each other. No superfluous thing is to be added otherwise it will spoil the charm of the story. Strike out all extra                     material that hinders the sequence of the story. You try to add only those ideas which help to move forward in a developing order.                     When you reach to its climax, the selection of the words is very important. You have not to conclude abrubtly rather                     chronologically. Your conclusion must be pin-point, well suited to the story and appreciable. A bad ending may work as a                     death-blow to the effect of an otherwise good story. So you must remain very cautious about the last part of the story.               English Grammar \& Composition IX-X                  144","If the purpose of the story is not only to give amusement but also to provide some lesson, it may be given in the form of a maxim,                 a proverb or a well knit sentence summing up the whole story.                 A heading to the story may also be asked to write. Most care is needed here. It depicts about what you are going to write. It can                 also be phrase, a maxim, a proverb, the name of a character, etc  but it must be well-suited to the story.                 If the outline is given, just follow it one by one, developing it into a logical and systematic order. No point should be left out. The                 sequence is to be maintained.                 Now the style of writing is equally important. Generally the stories are written in past tense. The sentences should be                 grammatically correct. The words must be well-chosen and appropriate to the requirement of the story. The questions or                 exclamatory remarks can also be used, if necessary, to make it natural and interesting.             According to prescribed format–               (i) You may be asked to write a story having a moral. It may be mentioned in the question paper and you have to write a story                 illustrating that moral.               (ii) You may be given an outline of the story.

When they were passing through a thick forest which was             full of wild and dangerous animals, they saw a bear running towards them. They promised to help each other if there was any danger             on the way. But after seeing the bear one of the friends climbed up a tree and hid himself among the branches.

It was decided whoever made him take off the coat would be the winner. The Wind tried first.

When he was wandering here and there, other animals came there and got             frightened to see a lion before them. And in a hurry, ran away from there. By chance a fox also came there.

(e)  What were the measures adopted to handle the situation or to tackle the incident.                     (f)  Mention the government's role, if any.                     (g)  Give your own suggestion, if any.                    In describing all the above details, be careful. You have not to be superfluous. Keep your attention centred round the main                     incident.                    Your language must be simple and clear without using much bombastic words.

Business was at its peak. Suddenly a smell spread all             around there. A lot of smoke was coming from the shopping Mall. All types of shopes were there. People rushed towards the site.             There was a devastating fire which had taken all the shops in its grip. The Fire Brigade was given an urgent call. People were             throwing water with the help of buckets and trying to save the lives of the persons who were inside. Fire Brigade reached but till then             50 shops were burnt to ashes. But it is a matter of relief that all the human beings were safe. There was no loss of life. The fire could be             extinguished in almost three hours. Its cause is still not known. Perhaps there is a possibility of a short-circuit.

Think yourself a reporter Sumati Deshmukh.                   – children – the beast of burden – school bag 5 to 10 kg – note books – physically exhausted – not receptive – aim of                   education – giving knowledge – delightful manner – lead to many diseases – backache – posture – doctors worried – advise                   to lessen the burden              Ans.

The weight of their school bags             is from 5 to 10 kg. Add to these the weight of notebooks for class work and home work. They are bogged down, their energy is sapped             and they are physically exhausted and mentally tired when the morning assembly begins. In such a frame of mind the student is not at             all receptive. While the aim of education is to fill us with life, vigour, energy and delight by imparting knowledge. It should develop             our head, heart and our overall health. While the present trend of carrying burdensome bag can lead to many diseases like chronic             backache, neck and posture problems. Even the doctors are worried.

This time when I went to a polling booth, I saw that             there were many supporters of different candidates standing outside. The voters were standing in a queue inside the hall. Ladies had             formed a separate queue. Every voter got in and put on his signature on the ballot paper. A polling clerk marked the fore finger with             indelible ink. The voter put the stamp on the ballot paper, folded it and put it into the ballot box. There was very tight security.

Yesterday a fatal car accident took place on the Kalka             road. The smash had been caused by a car coming down, which swept round a sharp corner at a speed of 40 miles an hour and crashed             into a car coming up. The vehicles caught fire but happily no one was killed, although the drivers and some others were seriously             injured who were taken away to a nearby hospital. The crowd gathered. There was a traffic jam as the two cars were wrecked in the             middle of the road. It took two hours to clear the road for the traffic. Till now nobody is reported to be dead. But to drive at such a             speed down a twisting mountain road is simply to meet disaster.                 5. You are Shalu Mahazan, a reporter for the 'Daily Times' Nagpur.

This group of nations is led by             India, which accounts for over 31 lakh child deaths per year. The reasons for this high rate of child mortality in India are ignorance,             illiteracy, poverty, lack of health facilities in some of India's states like Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.             Some children die while taking birth due to non-facilities of medical aid in poor families while some fall prey to ignorance. They are             not taken to hospitals in time.                  The other four countries are – China, which accounts for 12 lakh child deaths, Pakistan registers around 4 lakh and Bangladesh             and Indonesia jointly contribute over 3 lakh per year.                 6.

Families are broken, there is unemployment and life is more complicated now. First, they take it as             pleasure, but soon they feel that they can't live without it.

The camp lasted for seven days. Several             volunteers offered their services for plantation and other social assignments. They were divided in five groups. Each group was             given separate duty to perform. First group took the task of plantation. Plants were provided free of cost by the concerned authority.             The young children were made to understand the importance of education. Adult literacy counts much in the development of a place,             so it was also given due attention. The fourth group was asked to concentrate on cleanliness. They went door to door and told the             value of cleanliness and how such diseases malaria, dengue, dysentery, etc are the result of biting insects and uncovered food. Flies             sit on the heap of garbage and carry germs and leave them on food.

They had suffered a big loss in             farming. To repay the loan they had to take another loan from a private money lender, at a very high rate of interest. Even after             repaying a larger amount than the principal amount of loan, they could not repay the whole loan, i.e., the interest amount. This story is             shared by thousands of farmers in India who are suffering huge losses. The situation is so bad that many farmers see no way out of             this except to commit suicide. According to government figures 1,50,000 farmers have died between 1997 and 2005. Special efforts             are being made to alleviate problems of such agriculturists. Let us hope for the best.                                                                    157","15. Recently you visited an International Book Fair held at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.

There were shops all around displaying the             Indian as well as foreign master pieces. There was a huge crowd. Everybody seemed curious to purchase a few ones as there was a             discount on cash purchase. There were many cultural and entertainment centres too. Refreshment corners also attracted the crowd. I             also bought a book on science and took some refreshment. The visit was full of enthusiasm and fun. It added a new leaf to my             knowledge. If one wants to see and feel the pace of the modern world, I think, a visit to such a fair provides a window to peep into the             outside world.                 16.

The people who come looking for job from villages and work             as labourers settle down in temporary homes like tents, mud houses, with thatched roofs or tin slabs. Most of them do not have basic             amenities like water, electricity or plumbing, etc. Many such dwerllings together are called slums.                  A massive fire took place on Tuesday evening when a hut caught fire by the carelessness of a lady. All the tents and shelters             burnt to ashes. The fire spread so heavily that 10 persons are said to be dead and more than 40 had got serious burn injuries. Fire             Brigade reached in time but could save only a few lives. The injured people have been taken to the nearby hospital.                  The local district magistrate has ordered a probe into the matter. Money, clothes food and medicines are being distributed by the             volunteer organisations and many others.                17.

Near about 60 students and teachers attended it. Many             lectures were delivered by the responsible and eminent persons. There are a lot of miseries, animals are bound to suffer, like they are             used to carry heavy loads and also as a means of transport. Their skin is sold in the market for money. They are hunted for amusement             and are kept caged in zoo. The cart owner mercilessly beats the bulls. These animals need care. Films and slides were used to make             the people aware of their habitat, food habit, living habits, etc. The people should take precautionary measures to keep their animals             healthy. Their treatment is possible. The camp proved to be a success as it awakened our lost sympathy for animals. Animal life forms             an indistinguishable part of human life so an enlightened approach is essential towards animals. They should be allowed to live in             their natural habitat. They deserve it.                18. You are Satish Gupta, a press reporter. You felt very upset to see the condition of the children working as labourers in different                  factories.

These children are below eighteen but are bound to do work in industries, tea stalls, plastic industry, building sites,                                                                   158","restaurants, etc. They are not given enough food, paid less, over burdened and even tortured and exploited a lot. It is a blot on the             society. Although there is a law against such child labour yet it is not being implemented. Nobody cares about it. Even the parents of             such children are not aware of the fact. Sometimes the motive behind it is their greed. They don't speak to the owners against             exploitation. It is parents of such children who don't complain to higher authorities. The reason also may be their poverty. They             should come forward against child labour and should send their children to schools rather than to earn money.                19.

About four hundred             volunteers from different schools took a pledge to eliminate illiteracy from this area. As we all know that illiteracy is a blot on the fair             name of India. Many villagers are still illiterate and they are exploited by money lenders, big landlords and corrupt officials. There             can't be real growth and development of a nation and its citizens without being literate. Education is as necessary for mind as food for             body and that's why our constitution guarantees universal primary education for all. Students played an effective role in removing             the curse of illiteracy. By participating and by carrying the Lamp of  Literacy to the deprived ones, all the students indirectly served             the country. Outstanding volunteers got rewards and certificates.                                                          Exercises for Practice                1.
